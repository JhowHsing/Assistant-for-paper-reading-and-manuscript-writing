TI  - Effects of reciprocal transplantation on the microbiome and putative nitrogen
      cycling functions of the intertidal sponge, Hymeniacidon heliophila.
PG  - 43247

AB  - Microbial symbionts in sponges are ubiquitous, forming complex and highly diverse
      host-specific communities. Conspecific sponges display remarkable stability in
      their symbiont communities, both spatially and temporally, yet extreme
      fluctuations in environmental factors can cause shifts in host-symbiont
      associations. We previously demonstrated that the marine sponge Hymeniacidon
      heliophila displayed significant community-level differences in microbial
      symbiont diversity, structure and composition when sampled from intertidal and
      subtidal environments. Here, we conducted a 70-day reciprocal transplant
      experiment to directly test the effect of tidal exposure on the microbiome of H. 
      heliophila, using next-generation Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences 
      to characterize symbiont communities. While sponges transplanted between habitats
      displayed shifts in microbial communities after 70 days, temporal variation was
      the dominant factor affecting microbial community composition. Further, we
      identified core symbionts that persisted across these spatio-temporal scales and 
      used a metagenomic approach to show that these dominant members of the microbiome
      of H. heliophila represent nitrogen cycling taxa that have the potential to
      contribute to a diverse array of nitrogen transformations in the sponge
      holobiont. Together, these results indicate that despite moderate spatio-temporal
      shifts in symbiont composition, core symbiont functions (e.g. nitrogen cycling)
      can be maintained in sponge microbiomes through functional redundancy.

TI  - Identification and bioactive potential of marine microorganisms from selected
      Florida coastal areas.
LID - 10.1002/mbo3.448 [doi]
AB  - The ocean, with its rich untapped chemical biodiversity, continues to serve as a 
      source of potentially new therapeutic agents. The evaluation of the diversity of 
      cultivable microorganisms from the marine sponge Halichondria panicea and ocean
      sediment samples were examined and their potential as sources of antimicrobial
      and antiproliferative agents were investigated. The marine sponge and sediments
      were collected at different depths (0.9-6 meters) and locations in Florida,
      including Florida Keys, Port St. Joe in Pensacola, Pensacola Bay, Pensacola
      Beach, and Fort Pickens. Twenty-one cultivatable isolates were grouped according 
      to their morphology and identified using 16S rRNA molecular taxonomy. The
      bacterial community identified consisted of members belonging to the
      Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria (Alpha- and Gamma-classes) and
      Firmicutes phylogeny. Seven of the microbes exhibited mild to significant
      cytotoxic activities against five microbial indicators but no significant
      cytotoxic activities were observed against the pancreatic (PANC-1) nor the
      multidrug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines (NCI/ADR). This work reaffirms the 
      phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria as sources of potential bioactive natural
      product candidates for drug discovery and development.

TI  - Evaluating the core microbiota in complex communities: A systematic
      investigation.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.13647 [doi]
AB  - The study of complex microbial communities poses unique conceptual and analytical
      challenges, with microbial species potentially numbering in the thousands. With
      transient or allochthonous microorganisms often adding to this complexity, a
      'core' microbiota approach, focusing only on the stable and permanent members of 
      the community, is becoming increasingly popular. Given the various ways of
      defining a core microbiota, it is prudent to examine whether the definition of
      the core impacts upon the results obtained. Here we used complex marine sponge
      microbiotas and undertook a systematic evaluation of the degree to which
      different factors used to define the core influenced the conclusions. Significant
      differences in alpha- and beta-diversity were detected using some but not all
      core definitions. However, findings related to host specificity and environmental
      quality were largely insensitive to major changes in the core microbiota
      definition. Furthermore, none of the applied definitions altered our perception
      of the ecological networks summarising interactions among bacteria within the
      sponges. These results suggest that, while care should still be taken in
      interpretation, the core microbiota approach is surprisingly robust, at least for
      comparing microbiotas of closely related samples.

TI  - Culturable bacterial communities associated to Brazilian Oscarella species
      (Porifera: Homoscleromorpha) and their antagonistic interactions.
LID - 10.1007/s10482-016-0818-y [doi]
AB  - Sponges offer an excellent model to investigate invertebrate-microorganism
      interactions. Furthermore, bacteria associated with marine sponges represent a
      rich source of bioactive metabolites. The aim of this study was to characterize
      the bacteria inhabiting a genus of sponges, Oscarella, and their potentiality for
      antimicrobial production. Bacterial isolates were recovered from different
      Oscarella specimens, among which 337 were phylogenetically identified. The
      culturable community was dominated by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and Vibrio
      was the most frequently isolated genus, followed by Shewanella. When tested for
      antimicrobial production, bacteria of the 12 genera isolated were capable of
      producing antimicrobial substances. The majority of strains were involved in
      antagonistic interactions and inhibitory activities were also observed against
      bacteria of medical importance. It was more pronounced in some isolated genera
      (Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Photobacterium, Shewanella and Vibrio). These findings 
      suggest that chemical antagonism could play a significant role in shaping
      bacterial communities within Oscarella, a genus classified as low-microbial
      abundance sponge. Moreover, the identified strains may contribute to the search
      for new sources of antimicrobial substances, an important strategy for developing
      therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study 
      was the first to investigate the diversity and antagonistic activity of bacteria 
      isolated from Oscarella spp. It highlights the biotechnological potential of
      sponge-associated bacteria.

TI  - The Microbiome and Occurrence of Methanotrophy in Carnivorous Sponges.
PG  - 1781
AB  - As shown by recent studies, filter-feeding sponges are known to host a wide
      variety of microorganisms. However, the microbial community of the non-filtering 
      carnivorous sponges (Porifera, Cladorhizidae) has been the subject of less
      scrutiny. Here, we present the results from a comparative study of the
      methanotrophic carnivorous sponge Cladorhiza methanophila from a mud volcano-rich
      area at the Barbados Accretionary Prism, and five carnivorous species from the
      Jan Mayen Vent Field (JMVF) at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. Results from 16S rRNA 
      microbiome data indicate the presence of a diverse assemblage of associated
      microorganisms in carnivorous sponges mainly from the Gamma- and
      Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriaceae, and Thaumarchaeota. While the abundance
      of particular groups varied throughout the dataset, we found interesting
      similarities to previous microbiome results from non-carnivorous deep sea
      sponges, suggesting that the carnivorous sponges share characteristics of a
      previously hypothesized putative deep-sea sponge microbial community.
      Chemolithoautotrophic symbiosis was confirmed for C. methanophila through a
      microbial community with a high abundance of Methylococcales and very light
      isotopic delta13C and delta15N ratios (-60 to -66 per thousand/3.5 to 5.2 per
      thousand) compared to the other cladorhizid species (-22 to -24 per thousand/8.5 
      to 10.5 per thousand). We provide evidence for the presence of putative
      sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria in the arctic cladorhizids; however,
      delta13C and delta15N signatures did not provide evidence for significant
      chemoautotrophic symbiosis in this case, and the slightly higher abundance of
      cladorhizids at the JMVF site compared to the nearby deep sea likely stem from an
      increased abundance of prey rather than a more direct vent association. The
      phylogenetic position of C. methanophila in relation to other carnivorous sponges
      was established using a three-gene phylogenetic analysis, and it was found to be 
      closely related to other non-methanotrophic Cladorhiza species with a similar
      morphology included in the dataset, suggesting a recent origin for methanotrophy 
      in this species. C. methanophila remains the only known carnivorous sponge with a
      strong, chemolithoautotrophic symbiont association, and methanotrophic symbiosis 
      does not seem to be a widespread property within the Cladorhizidae.

AB  - Many marine sponges are populated by dense and taxonomically diverse microbial
      consortia. We employed a metagenomics approach to unravel the differences in the 
      functional gene repertoire among three Mediterranean sponge species, Petrosia
      ficiformis, Sarcotragus foetidus, Aplysina aerophoba and seawater. Different
      signatures were observed between sponge and seawater metagenomes with regard to
      microbial community composition, GC content, and estimated bacterial genome size.
      Our analysis showed further a pronounced repertoire for defense systems in sponge
      metagenomes. Specifically, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
      repeats, restriction modification, DNA phosphorothioation and phage growth
      limitation systems were enriched in sponge metagenomes. These data suggest that
      defense is an important functional trait for an existence within sponges that
      requires mechanisms to defend against foreign DNA from microorganisms and
      viruses. This study contributes to an understanding of the evolutionary arms race
      between viruses/phages and bacterial genomes and it sheds light on the bacterial 
      defenses that have evolved in the context of the sponge holobiont.

TI  - High-density natural luffa sponge as anaerobic microorganisms carrier for
      degrading 1,1,1-TCA in groundwater.
PG  - 383-393
LID - 10.1007/s00449-016-1706-6 [doi]
AB  - Anaerobic microorganisms were applied to degrade organic contaminants in
      groundwater with permeable reactive barriers (PRBs). However, anaerobic
      microorganisms need to select optimal immobilizing material as carrier. The
      potential of high-density natural luffa sponge (HDLS) (a new variety of luffa)
      for the immobilization and protection of anaerobic microorganisms was
      investigated. The HDLS has a dense structure composed of a complicated interwoven
      fibrous network. Therefore, the abrasion rate of HDLS (0.0068 g s-1) was the
      smallest among the four carriers [HDLS, ordinary natural luffa sponge (OLS),
      polyurethane sponge (PS), and gel carrier AQUAPOROUSGEL (APG)]. The results
      suggest that it also had the greatest water retention (10.26 H2O-g dry
      carrier-g-1) and SS retention (0.21 g dry carrier-g-1). In comparison to
      well-established commercialized gel carrier APG, HDLS was of much better
      mechanical strength, hydrophilicity and stability. Microbial-immobilized HDLS
      also had the best performance for the remediation of 1,1,1-TCA simulated
      groundwater. Analysis of the clone libraries from microorganism-immobilized HDLS 
      showed the HDLS could protect microorganisms from the toxicity of 1,1,1-TCA and
      maintain the stability of microbial community diversity. The mechanism of HDLS
      immobilizing and protecting microorganisms was proposed as follows. The HDLS had 
      a micron-scale honeycomb structure (30-40 mum) and an irregular ravine structure 
      (4-20 mum), which facilitate the immobilization of anaerobic microorganisms and
      protect the anaerobic microorganisms.

AB  - Sponges host complex symbiotic communities, but to date, the whole picture of the
      metabolic potential of sponge microbiota remains unclear, particularly the
      difference between the shallow-water and deep-sea sponge holobionts. In this
      study, two completely different sponges, shallow-water sponge Theonella swinhoei 
      from the South China Sea and deep-sea sponge Neamphius huxleyi from the Indian
      Ocean, were selected to compare their whole symbiotic communities and metabolic
      potential, particularly in element transformation. Phylogenetically diverse
      bacteria, archaea, fungi, and algae were detected in both shallow-water sponge T.
      swinhoei and deep-sea sponge N. huxleyi, and different microbial community
      structures were indicated between these two sponges. Metagenome-based gene
      abundance analysis indicated that, though the two sponge microbiota have similar 
      core functions, they showed different potential strategies in detailed metabolic 
      processes, e.g., in the transformation and utilization of carbon, nitrogen,
      phosphorus, and sulfur by corresponding microbial symbionts. This study provides 
      insight into the putative metabolic potentials of the microbiota associated with 
      the shallow-water and deep-sea sponges at the whole community level, extending
      our knowledge of the sponge microbiota's functions, the association of sponge-
      microbes, as well as the adaption of sponge microbiota to the marine environment.

TI  - Combination of zero-valent iron and anaerobic microorganisms immobilized in luffa
      sponge for degrading 1,1,1-trichloroethane and the relevant microbial community
      analysis.
PG  - 783-796
LID - 10.1007/s00253-016-7933-6 [doi]
AB  - 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL), is
      relatively slow to remediate naturally; combination of zero-valent iron and
      immobilized microorganism is a potential means to accelerate DNAPL
      biodegradation. We first adopted high density luffa sponge (HDLS) as immobilized 
      microorganism carrier. The experimental results demonstrated that (1) the
      supernatant liquid microorganisms were the optimal immobilized microorganisms for
      HDLS and (2) the combination of zero-valent iron and immobilized microorganisms
      accelerated 1,1,1-TCA transformation. Furthermore, in the long-term remediation
      process, anaerobic microorganisms produced reductant H2S which was beneficial to 
      zero-valent iron PRBs. Through further study of the microbial community, we found
      that majority of the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) perfectly adapted to the
      process of 1,1,1-TCA co-metabolism dechlorination. Desulfobulbus and
      Desulfococcus potentially were the special SRB that contributed significantly to 
      TCA co-metabolism. Additionally, 1,1,1-TCA induced the generation of new SRB and 
      stimulated the growth of majority of dominating methanogens. The results
      indicated that they played a constructive role in accelerating the dechlorination
      of 1,1,1-TCA, reduction of sulfate, and improving the production of CH4.
      Consequently, combination of zero-valent iron and immobilized microorganisms for 
      remediating groundwater by contaminated 1,1,1-TCA is a sustainable and green
      remediation technology. Especially for groundwater of SO42- type contaminated by 
      1,1,1-TCA, in the long-term course of combination degradation, cyclic utilization
      of H2S to prolong the service life of zero-valent iron PRBs. H2 and CH4 generated
      to capture as potential energy resource. Based on this, a tentative reaction
      mechanism for Fe0 biodegradation of 1,1,1-TCA was proposed.

TI  - The role of sponge-bacteria interactions: the sponge Aplysilla rosea challenged
      by its associated bacterium Streptomyces ACT-52A in a controlled aquarium system.
PG  - 10609-10626
AB  - Sponge-associated bacteria play a critical role in sponge biology, metabolism and
      ecology, but how they interact with their host sponges and the role of these
      interactions are poorly understood. This study investigated the role of the
      interaction between the sponge Aplysilla rosea and its associated
      actinobacterium, Streptomyces ACT-52A, in modifying sponge microbial diversity,
      metabolite profile and bioactivity. A recently developed experimental approach
      that exposes sponges to bacteria of interest in a controlled aquarium system was 
      improved by including the capture and analysis of secreted metabolites by the
      addition of an absorbent resin in the seawater. In a series of controlled
      aquaria, A. rosea was exposed to Streptomyces ACT-52A at 106 cfu/ml and monitored
      for up to 360 h. Shifts in microbial communities associated with the sponges
      occurred within 24 to 48 h after bacterial exposure and continued until 360 h, as
      revealed by TRFLP. The metabolite profiles of sponge tissues also changed
      substantially as the microbial community shifted. Control sponges (without added 
      bacteria) and Streptomyces ACT-52A-exposed sponges released different metabolites
      into the seawater that was captured by the resin. The antibacterial activity of
      compounds collected from the seawater increased at 96 and 360 h of exposure for
      the treated sponges compared to the control group due to new compounds being
      produced and released. Increased antibacterial activity of metabolites from
      treated sponge tissue was observed only at 360 h, whereas that of control sponge 
      tissue remained unchanged. The results demonstrate that the interaction between
      sponges and their associated bacteria plays an important role in regulating
      secondary metabolite production.

TI  - New Genomic Insights into "Entotheonella" Symbionts in Theonella swinhoei:
      Mixotrophy, Anaerobic Adaptation, Resilience, and Interaction.
PG  - 1333
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01333 [doi]
AB  - "Entotheonella" (phylum "Tectomicrobia") is a filamentous symbiont that produces 
      almost all known bioactive compounds derived from the Lithistida sponge Theonella
      swinhoei. In contrast to the comprehensive knowledge of its secondary metabolism,
      knowledge of its lifestyle, resilience, and interaction with the sponge host and 
      other symbionts remains rudimentary. In this study, we obtained two
      "Entotheonella" genomes from T. swinhoei from the South China Sea through
      metagenome binning, and used a RASTtk pipeline to achieve better genome
      annotation. The high average nucleotide index values suggested they were the same
      phylotypes as the two "Entotheonella" phylotypes from T. swinhoei from the Japan 
      Sea. Genomic features related to utilization of various carbon sources, peptidase
      secretion, CO2 fixation, sulfate reduction, anaerobic respiration, and
      denitrification indicated the mixotrophic nature of "Entotheonella." The
      endospore-forming potential along with metal- and antibiotic resistance indicated
      "Entotheonella" was highly resilient to harsh conditions. The potential for
      endospore formation also explained the widespread distribution of "Entotheonella"
      to some extent. The discovery of Type II (general secretion pathway proteins and 
      the Widespread Colonization Island) and Type VI secretion systems in
      "Entotheonella" suggested it could secrete extracellular hydrolases, form tight
      adhesion, act against phagocytes, and kill other prokaryotes. Overall, the newly 
      discovered genomic features suggest "Entotheonella" is a highly competitive
      member of the symbiotic community of T. swinhoei.

      from depths of 760-2900 m below sea level, were investigated using 454
      pyrosequencing for their secondary metabolomic potential targeting adenylation
      domain and ketosynthase domain sequences. The data obtained suggest a diverse
      microbial origin of nonribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthase
      fragments that in part correlates with their respective microbial community
      structures that were previously described and reveals an untapped source of
      potential novelty. The sequences, especially the ketosynthase fragments, display 
      extensive clade formations which are clearly distinct from sequences hosted in
      public databases, therefore highlighting the potential of the microbiome of these
      deep sea sponges to produce potentially novel small-molecule chemistry.
      Furthermore, sequence similarities to gene clusters known to be involved in the
      production of many classes of antibiotics and toxins including lipopeptides,
      glycopeptides, macrolides, and hepatotoxins were also identified.

TI  - Development of slow sponge sand filter (SpSF) as a post-treatment of UASB-DHS
      reactor effluent treating municipal wastewater.

AB  - In this study, conventional slow sand filter (SSF) and modified slow sponge sand 
      filter (SpSF) were investigated for the post-treatment of up-flow anaerobic
      sludge blanket (UASB)-down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor effluent. The
      seasonal variation did not show significant differences in removal efficiencies
      of both filters. However in summer, both filters were able to achieve high total 
      suspended solids and total biochemical oxygen demand removal averaging 97% and
      99%, respectively. Contrary to organic removal, total nitrogen removal efficiency
      was satisfactory, showing increased removal efficiencies averaging 58% and 62%
      for SSF and SpSF in summer. On the other hand, average total coliform removal of 
      SSF and SpSF was 4.2 logs and 4.4 logs and corresponding Escherichia coli removal
      was 4.0 logs and 4.1 logs, respectively. From our observation, it could be
      concluded that the relative performance of SpSF for nutrients and coliforms was
      better than SSF due to the effectiveness of sponge media over fine sands.
      Moreover, microbial community analysis revealed that the members of phylum
      Proteobacteria were predominant in the biofilms of both filters, which could have
      contributed to pollutant removal. Therefore, SpSF could be concluded to be a
      suitable post-treatment of UASB-DHS system in warmer conditions.

TI  - Diversity, structure and convergent evolution of the global sponge microbiome.
PG  - 11870
LID - 10.1038/ncomms11870 [doi]
AB  - Sponges (phylum Porifera) are early-diverging metazoa renowned for establishing
      complex microbial symbioses. Here we present a global Porifera microbiome survey,
      set out to establish the ecological and evolutionary drivers of these
      host-microbe interactions. We show that sponges are a reservoir of exceptional
      microbial diversity and major contributors to the total microbial diversity of
      the world's oceans. Little commonality in species composition or structure is
      evident across the phylum, although symbiont communities are characterized by
      specialists and generalists rather than opportunists. Core sponge microbiomes are
      stable and characterized by generalist symbionts exhibiting amensal and/or
      commensal interactions. Symbionts that are phylogenetically unique to sponges do 
      not disproportionally contribute to the core microbiome, and host phylogeny
      impacts complexity rather than composition of the symbiont community. Our
      findings support a model of independent assembly and evolution in symbiont
      communities across the entire host phylum, with convergent forces resulting in
      analogous community organization and interactions.

      sequencing revealed high microbial diversity.

AB  - Sponges are primitive metazoans that are known to harbour diverse and abundant
      microbes. All over the world attempts are being made to exploit these microbes
      for their biotechnological potential to produce, bioactive compounds and
      antimicrobial peptides. However, the majority of the studies are focussed on the 
      marine sponges and studies on the freshwater sponges have been neglected so far. 
      To increase our understanding of the microbial community structure of freshwater 
      sponges, microbiota of two fresh water sponges namely, Eunapius carteri and
      Corvospongilla lapidosa is explored for the first time using Next Generation
      Sequencing (NGS) technology. Overall the microbial composition of these sponges
      comprises of 14 phyla and on an average, more than 2900 OTUs were obtained from
      C. lapidosa while E. carteri showed 980 OTUs which is higher than OTUs obtained
      in the marine sponges. Thus, our study showed that, fresh water sponges also
      posses highly diverse microbial community than previously thought and it is
      distinct from the marine sponge microbiota. The present study also revealed that 
      microbial community structure of both the sponges is significantly different from
      each other and their respective water samples. In the present study, we have
      detected many bacterial lineages belonging to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria,
      Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, etc. that are known to produce compounds of
      biotechnological importance. Overall, this study gives insight into the microbial
      composition of the freshwater sponges which is highly diverse and needs to be
      studied further to exploit their biotechnological capabilities.

      Microbiome.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.00499 [doi]
AB  - Sponges host complex microbial communities of recognized ecological and
      biotechnological importance. Extensive cultivation efforts have been made to
      isolate sponge bacteria, but most still elude cultivation. To identify the
      bottlenecks of sponge bacterial cultivation, we combined high-throughput 16S rRNA
      gene sequencing with a variety of cultivation media and incubation conditions. We
      aimed to determine the extent to which sample processing and cultivation
      conditions can impact bacterial viability and recovery in culture. We isolated
      325 sponge bacteria from six specimens of Cymbastela concentrica and three
      specimens of Scopalina sp. These isolates were distributed over 37 different
      genera and 47 operational taxonomic units (defined at 97% 16S rRNA gene sequence 
      identity). The cultivable bacterial community was highly specific to its sponge
      host and different media compositions yielded distinct microbial isolates. Around
      97% of the isolates could be detected in the original sponge and represented a
      large but highly variable proportion (0.5-92% total abundance, depending on
      sponge species) of viable bacteria obtained after sample processing, as
      determined by propidium monoazide selective DNA modification of compromised
      cells. Our results show that the most abundant viable bacteria are also the most 
      predominant groups found in cultivation, reflecting, to some extent, the relative
      abundances of the viable bacterial community, rather than the overall community
      estimated by direct molecular approaches. Cultivation is therefore shaped not
      only by the growth conditions provided, but also by the different cell
      viabilities of the bacteria that constitute the cultivation inoculum. These
      observations highlight the need to perform experiments to assess each method of
      sample processing for its accurate representation of the actual in situ bacterial
      community and its yield of viable cells.

TI  - [Distinctive Features of the Microbial Diversity and the Polyketide Synthase
      GenesSpectrum in the Community of the Endemic Baikal Sponge Swartschewskia
      papyracea].
PG  - 47-58
AB  - The diversity of the symbiotic community of the endemic Baikal sponge
      Swartschewskia papyracea was studied, and an analysis of the polyketide synthases
      genes spectrum in sponge-associated microorganisms was carried out. Six bacterial
      phyla were detected in the S. papyracea microbiome, namely, Verrucomicrobia,
      Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Planctomycetes.
      Unlike the microbial associations of other freshwater sponges, the community
      under study was dominated by the Verrucomicrobia (42.1%) and Cyanobacteria
      (17.5%) phyla, while the proportion of the Proteobacteria was unusually low
      (9.7%). In the S. papyracea community metagenome, there were identified 18
      polyketide synthases genes fragments, the closest homologs of which included the 
      polyketide synthases of the microorganisms belonging to the bacterial phyla
      Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria (Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and
      Gammaproteobacteria classes), and Acidobacteria and to the eukaryotic algae of
      the Heterokonta phylum (Eustigmatophyceae class). Polyketide synthase sequences
      from S. papyracea formed three groups on the phylogenetic tree: a group of hybrid
      NRPS/PKS complexes, a group of cyanobacterial polyketide synthases, and a group
      of homologs of the eukaryotic alga Nannochloropsis galiana. Notably, the
      identified polyketide synthase genes fragments showed only a 57-88% similarity to
      the sequences in the databases, which implies the presence of genes controlling
      the synthesis of the novel, still unstudied, polyketide compounds in the S.
      papyracea community. It was proposed that the habitation conditions of S.
      papyracea affect the taxonomic composition of the microorganisms associated with 
      the sponge, including the diversity of the producers of secondary metabolites.

AB  - Coral reefs harbor the most diverse assemblages in the ocean, however, a large
      proportion of the diversity is cryptic and, therefore, undetected by standard
      visual census techniques. Cryptic and exposed communities differ considerably in 
      species composition and ecological function. This study compares three different 
      coral reef assessment protocols: i) visual benthic reef surveys: ii) visual
      census of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) plates; and iii)
      metabarcoding techniques of the ARMS (including sessile, 106-500 mum and 500-2000
      mum size fractions), that target the cryptic and exposed communities of three
      reefs in the central Red Sea. Visual census showed a dominance of Cnidaria
      (Anthozoa) and Rhodophyta on the reef substrate, while Porifera, Bryozoa and
      Rhodophyta were the most abundant groups on the ARMS plates. Metabarcoding,
      targeting the 18S rRNA gene, significantly increased estimates of the species
      diversity (p < 0.001); revealing that Annelida were generally the dominant phyla 
      (in terms of reads) of all fractions and reefs. Furthermore, metabarcoding
      detected microbial eukaryotic groups such as Syndiniophyceae, Mamiellophyceae and
      Bacillariophyceae as relevant components of the sessile fraction. ANOSIM analysis
      showed that the three reef sites showed no differences based on the visual census
      data. Metabarcoding showed a higher sensitivity for identifying differences
      between reef communities at smaller geographic scales than standard visual census
      techniques as significant differences in the assemblages were observed amongst
      the reefs. Comparison of the techniques showed no similar patterns for the visual
      techniques while the metabarcoding of the ARMS showed similar patterns amongst
      fractions. Establishing ARMS as a standard tool in reef monitoring will not only 
      advance our understanding of local processes and ecological community response to
      environmental changes, as different faunal components will provide complementary 
      information but also improve the estimates of biodiversity in coral reef benthic 
      communities. This study lays the foundations for further studies looking at
      integrating traditional reef survey methodologies with complementary approaches, 
      such as metabarcoding, which investigate other components of the reef community.

TI  - In four shallow and mesophotic tropical reef sponges from Guam the microbial
      community largely depends on host identity.
PG  - e1936

AB  - Sponges (phylum Porifera) are important members of almost all aquatic ecosystems,
      and are renowned for hosting often dense and diverse microbial communities. While
      the specificity of the sponge microbiota seems to be closely related to host
      phylogeny, the environmental factors that could shape differences within local
      sponge-specific communities remain less understood. On tropical coral reefs,
      sponge habitats can span from shallow areas to deeper, mesophotic sites. These
      habitats differ in terms of environmental factors such as light, temperature, and
      food availability, as well as anthropogenic impact. In order to study the host
      specificity and potential influence of varying habitats on the sponge microbiota 
      within a local area, four tropical reef sponges, Rhabdastrella globostellata,
      Callyspongia sp., Rhaphoxya sp., and Acanthella cavernosa, were collected from
      exposed shallow reef slopes and a deep reef drop-off. Based on 16S rRNA gene
      pyrosequencing profiles, beta diversity analyses revealed that each sponge
      species possessed a specific microbiota that was significantly different to those
      of the other species and exhibited attributes that are characteristic of high-
      and/or low-microbial-abundance sponges. These findings emphasize the influence of
      host identity on the associated microbiota. Dominant sponge- and
      seawater-associated bacterial phyla were Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, and
      Proteobacteria. Comparison of individual sponge taxa and seawater samples between
      shallow and deep reef sites revealed no significant variation in alpha diversity 
      estimates, while differences in microbial beta diversity (variation in community 
      composition) were significant for Callyspongia sp. sponges and seawater samples. 
      Overall, the sponge-associated microbiota is significantly shaped by host
      identity across all samples, while the effect of habitat differentiation seems to
      be less predominant in tropical reef sponges.

TI  - Inhabitancy of active Nitrosopumilus-like ammonia-oxidizing archaea and

AB  - Nitrification directly contributes to the ammonia removal in sponges, and it
      plays an indispensable role in sponge-mediated nitrogen cycle. Previous studies
      have demonstrated genomic evidences of nitrifying lineages in the sponge
      Theonella swinhoei. However, little is known about the transcriptional activity
      of nitrifying community in this sponge. In this study, combined DNA- and
      transcript-based analyses were performed to reveal the composition and
      transcriptional activity of the nitrifiers in T. swinhoei from the South China
      Sea. Transcriptional activity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and
      nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in this sponge were confirmed by targeting their
      nitrifying genes,16S rRNA genes and their transcripts. Phylogenetic analysis
      coupled with RDP rRNA classification indicated that archaeal 16S rRNA genes, amoA
      (the subunit of ammonia monooxygenase) genes and their transcripts were closely
      related to Nitrosopumilus-like AOA; whereas nitrifying bacterial 16S rRNA genes, 
      nxrB (the subunit of nitrite oxidoreductase) genes and their transcripts were
      closely related to Nitrospira NOB. Quantitative assessment demonstrated relative 
      higher abundances of nitrifying genes and transcripts of Nitrosopumilus-like AOA 
      than those of Nitrospira NOB in this sponge. This study illustrated the
      transcriptional potentials of Nitrosopumilus-like archaea and Nitrospira bacteria
      that would predominantly contribute to the nitrification functionality in the
      South China Sea T. swinhoei.

      Microorganisms].
PG  - 1335-40
AB  - The diversity of 16S rRNA genes in the microbial community of endemic sponge
      Lubomirskia baicalensis with bleached patches of tissue was studied. Eight
      bacterial phyla were identified in the sponge microbiome: Cyanobacteria (27.3%; n
      = 36; 2 OTU, operational taxonomic unit), Proteobacteria (22.7%; n = 30; 5 OTU), 
      Actinobacteria (16.7%; n = 22; 7 OTU, operation taxonomic unit), Verrucomicrobia 
      (15.2%; n = 20; 4 OTU), Plactomycetes (9%; n = 12; 3 OTU), Bacteroidetes (4.5%; n
      = 6; 3 OTU), WS5 (3%; n = 4; 1 OTU), and TM7 (1.5%; n = 2; 1 OTU). The basic
      phyla typical of freshwater sponge microbiomes are present in the community.
      However, in contrast to previously studied L. baicalensis bacterial associations,
      a dominance of Cyanobacteria and a low number of representatives of the
      Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria were observed in the bleached sponge
      community. Phylotypes exhibiting a high percentage of similarity with the
      microorganisms inhabiting substrates rich in organic matter were also found.
      Clearly, the bleaching processes of Baikal sponges affect the composition and the
      ratio of the major taxonomic groups of sponge-associated bacteria.

AB  - Soluble microbial products (SMP) produced in bioprocesses have been known as a
      main cause to decrease treatment efficiency, lower effluent quality, and promote 
      membrane fouling in water reclamation plants. In this study, biological
      degradation of SMP using selectively enriched microbial consortia in a down-flow 
      hanging sponge (DHS) reactor was introduced to remove SMP discharged from
      anaerobic methanogenic reactors. On average, 68.9-87.5% SMP removal was achieved 
      by the enriched microbial consortia in the DHS reactor for >800 days. The
      influent SMP fed to the DHS reactor exhibited a bimodal molecular weight (MW)
      distribution with 14-20 kDa and <4 kDa. Between these two types of SMP, the small
      MW SMP were biodegraded in the upper part of the reactor, together with most of
      the large MW SMP. Using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing technology, the microbial
      community composition and structure were characterized and correlated with
      operational factors, such as hydraulic retention time, organic loading rate, and 
      removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand at different depths of the reactor, by 
      performing network and redundancy analyses. The results revealed that
      Saprospiraceae was strongly correlated to the increasing SMP loading condition,
      indicating positive co-occurrences with neighboring bacterial populations.
      Different microbial diversity along with the depth of the reactor implies that
      stratified microbial communities could participate in the process of SMP
      degradation. Taken together, these observations indicate that the spatial and
      temporal variability of the enriched microbial community in the DHS reactor could
      effectively treat SMP with respect to changes in the operational factors.

TI  - Environmental drivers of microbial community shifts in the giant barrel sponge,

PG  - 2025-38
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.13226 [doi]
AB  - The giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta, is a high microbial abundance sponge 
      found on Caribbean coral reefs along shallow to mesophotic depth gradients where 
      multiple abiotic factors change with depth. Sponges were collected along a depth 
      gradient at Little Cayman (LC) and Lee Stocking Island (LSI), and the microbiome 
      of these samples was analysed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Statistically
      significant shifts in community structure and dissimilarity ( approximately 40%) 
      were detected from 10 to 90 m in LC sponges, but a similar shift was not
      identified in sponges from 10 to 60 m at LSI (only 17% dissimilar). Additionally,
      inorganic nutrient levels steadily increased with depth at LSI but not at LC.
      Based on bulk stable isotopic variability, sponges collected from LC were
      generally more enriched in (15) N and less enriched in (13) C as depth increased,
      suggesting a transition from dependency on photoautotrophy to heterotrophy as
      depth increased. Patterns of stable isotopic enrichment were largely invariant at
      LSI, which is also reflected in the more stable microbial community along the
      depth gradient. It appears that environmental factors that change with depth may 
      contribute to differences in X. muta microbial assemblages, demonstrating the
      importance of contemporaneous environmental sampling in studies of the microbiome
      of sponges.

      how these associations vary with biogeography and environment is less clear. Here
      we compared the microbiome of an ecologically important sponge species,
      Carteriospongia foliascens, over a large geographic area and identified
      environmental factors likely responsible for driving microbial community
      differences between inshore and offshore locations using co-occurrence networks
      (NWs). The microbiome of C. foliascens exhibited exceptionally high microbial
      richness, with more than 9,000 OTUs identified at 97% sequence similarity. A
      large biogeographic signal was evident at the OTU level despite similar phyla
      level diversity being observed across all geographic locations. The C. foliascens
      bacterial community was primarily comprised of Gammaproteobacteria (34.2% +/-
      3.4%) and Cyanobacteria (32.2% +/- 3.5%), with lower abundances of
      Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, unidentified Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, 
      Acidobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. Co-occurrence NWs revealed a consistent
      increase in the proportion of Cyanobacteria over Bacteroidetes between turbid
      inshore and oligotrophic offshore locations, suggesting that the specialist
      microbiome of C. foliascens is driven by environmental factors.

AB  - Sponges harbor a remarkable diversity of microbial symbionts in which signal
      molecules can accumulate and enable cell-cell communication, such as quorum
      sensing (QS). Bacteria capable of QS were isolated from marine sponges; however, 
      an extremely small fraction of the sponge microbiome is amenable to cultivation. 
      We took advantage of community genome assembly and binning to investigate the
      uncultured majority of sponge symbionts. We identified a complete
      N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-QS system (designated TswIR) and seven partial
      luxI homologues in the microbiome of Theonella swinhoei. The TswIR system was
      novel and shown to be associated with an alphaproteobacterium of the order
      Rhodobacterales, here termed Rhodobacterales bacterium TS309. The tswI gene, when
      expressed in Escherichia coli, produced three AHLs, two of which were also
      identified in a T. swinhoei sponge extract. The taxonomic affiliation of the 16S 
      rRNA of Rhodobacterales bacterium TS309 to a sponge-coral specific clade, its
      enrichment in sponge versus seawater and marine sediment samples, and the
      presence of sponge-specific features, such as ankyrin-like domains and
      tetratricopeptide repeats, indicate a likely symbiotic nature of this bacterium.

AB  - Glass sponge (Hexactinellida, Porifera) is a special lineage because of its
      unique tissue organization and skeleton material. Structure and physiology of
      glass sponge have been extensively studied. However, our knowledge of the glass
      sponge-associated microbial community and of the interaction with the host is
      rather limited. Here, we performed genomic studies on the microbial community in 
      the glass sponge Lophophysema eversa in seamount. The microbial community was
      dominated by an ammonia-oxidizing archaeum (AOA), a nitrite-oxidizing bacterium
      (NOB) and a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium (SOB), all of which were autotrophs.
      Genomic analysis on the AOA, NOB and SOB in the sponge revealed specific
      functional features of sponge-associated microorganisms in comparison with the
      closely related free-living relatives, including chemotaxis, phage defence,
      vitamin biosynthesis and nutrient uptake among others, which are related to
      ecological functions. The three autotrophs play essential roles in the cycles of 
      carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in the microenvironment inside the sponge body, and
      they are considered to play symbiotic roles in the host as scavengers of toxic
      ammonia, nitrite and sulfide. Our study extends knowledge regarding the
      metabolism and the evolution of chemolithotrophs inside the invertebrate body.

TI  - Development of a BR-UASB-DHS system for natural rubber processing wastewater
      treatment.
PG  - 1-24
AB  - Natural rubber processing wastewater contains high concentrations of organic
      compounds, nitrogen, and other contaminants. In this study, a treatment system
      composed of a baffled reactor (BR), an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)
      reactor, and a downflow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor was used to treat natural
      rubber processing wastewater in Vietnam. The BR showed good total suspended
      solids removal of 47.6%, as well as acidification of wastewater. The UASB reactor
      achieved a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of 92.7% +/- 2.3%
      and energy recovery in the form of methane with an organic loading rate of 12.2
      +/- 6.6 kg-COD.m-3.day-1. The DHS reactor showed a high performance in residual
      organic matter removal from UASB effluent. In total, the system achieved
      high-level total COD removal of 98.6% +/- 1.2% and total suspended solids removal
      of 98.0% +/- 1.4%. Massive parallel 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the retained
      sludge in the UASB reactor showed the predominant microbial phyla to be
      Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, WWE1, and Euryarchaeota. Uncultured
      bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes and Phylum WWE1 were predominant
      in the UASB reactor. This microbial assemblage utilizes the organic compounds
      contained in natural rubber processing wastewater. In addition, the
      methane-producing archaea Methanosaeta sp. and Methanolinea sp. were detected.

TI  - Variation in species diversity and functional traits of sponge communities near
      human populations in Bocas del Toro, Panama.
PG  - e1385
LID - 10.7717/peerj.1385 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have renewed interest in sponge ecology by emphasizing the
      functional importance of sponges in a broad array of ecosystem services. Many
      critically important habitats occupied by sponges face chronic stressors that
      might lead to alterations in their diversity, relatedness, and functional
      attributes. We addressed whether proximity to human activity might be a
      significant factor in structuring sponge community composition, as well as
      potential functional roles, by monitoring sponge diversity and abundance at two
      structurally similar sites that vary in distance to areas of high coastal
      development in Bocas Del Toro, Panama. We surveyed sponge communities at each
      site using belt transects and differences between two sites were compared using
      the following variables: (1) sponge species richness, Shannon diversity, and
      inverse Simpson's diversity; (2) phylogenetic diversity; (3) taxonomic and
      phylogenetic beta diversity; (4) trait diversity and dissimilarity; and (5)
      phylogenetic and trait patterns in community structure. We observed significantly
      higher sponge diversity at Punta Caracol, the site most distant from human
      development ( approximately 5 km). Although phylogenetic diversity was lower at
      Saigon Bay, the site adjacent to a large village including many houses,
      businesses, and an airport, the sites did not exhibit significantly different
      patterns of phylogenetic relatedness in species composition. However, each site
      had a distinct taxonomic and phylogenetic composition (beta diversity). In
      addition, the sponge community at Saigon included a higher relative abundance of 
      sponges with high microbial abundance and high chlorophyll a concentration,
      whereas the community at Punta Caracol had a more even distribution of these
      traits, yielding a significant difference in functional trait diversity between
      sites. These results suggest that lower diversity and potentially altered
      community function might be associated with proximity to human populations. This 
      study highlights the importance of evaluating functional traits and phylogenetic 
      diversity in addition to common diversity metrics when assessing potential
      environmental impacts on benthic communities.

      a high degree of host specificity. The microbiomes of conspecific sponges are
      relatively constant, even across distant locations, yet few studies have directly
      examined the influence of abiotic factors on intraspecific variation in sponge
      microbial community structure. The contrast between intertidal and subtidal
      environments is an ideal system to assess the effect of environmental variation
      on sponge-microbe symbioses, producing two drastically different environments on 
      a small spatial scale. Here, we characterized the microbial communities of
      individual intertidal and subtidal Hymeniacidon heliophila sponges, ambient
      seawater, and sediment from a North Carolina oyster reef habitat by partial
      (Illumina sequencing) and nearly full-length (clone libraries) 16S rRNA gene
      sequence analyses. Clone library sequences were compared to H. heliophila
      symbiont communities from the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, revealing strong host
      specificity of dominant symbiont taxa across expansive geographic distances.
      Sediment and seawater samples yielded clearly distinct microbial communities from
      those found in H. heliophila. Despite the close proximity of the sponges sampled,
      significant differences between subtidal and intertidal sponges in the diversity,
      structure, and composition of their microbial communities were detected.
      Differences were driven by changes in the relative abundance of a few dominant
      microbial symbiont taxa, as well as the presence or absence of numerous rare
      microbial taxa. These findings suggest that extreme abiotic fluctuations, such as
      periodic air exposure in intertidal habitats, can drive intraspecific differences
      in complex host-microbe symbioses.

TI  - Characterization of Bacterial, Archaeal and Eukaryote Symbionts from Antarctic
      Sponges Reveals a High Diversity at a Three-Domain Level and a Particular
      Signature for This Ecosystem.
PG  - e0138837
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0138837 [doi]
AB  - Sponge-associated microbial communities include members from the three domains of
      life. In the case of bacteria, they are diverse, host specific and different from
      the surrounding seawater. However, little is known about the diversity and
      specificity of Eukarya and Archaea living in association with marine sponges.
      This knowledge gap is even greater regarding sponges from regions other than
      temperate and tropical environments. In Antarctica, marine sponges are abundant
      and important members of the benthos, structuring the Antarctic marine ecosystem.
      In this study, we used high throughput ribosomal gene sequencing to investigate
      the three-domain diversity and community composition from eight different
      Antarctic sponges. Taxonomic identification reveals that they belong to families 
      Acarnidae, Chalinidae, Hymedesmiidae, Hymeniacidonidae, Leucettidae,
      Microcionidae, and Myxillidae. Our study indicates that there are different
      diversity and similarity patterns between bacterial/archaeal and eukaryote
      microbial symbionts from these Antarctic marine sponges, indicating inherent
      differences in how organisms from different domains establish symbiotic
      relationships. In general, when considering diversity indices and number of phyla
      detected, sponge-associated communities are more diverse than the planktonic
      communities. We conclude that three-domain microbial communities from Antarctic
      sponges are different from surrounding planktonic communities, expanding previous
      observations for Bacteria and including the Antarctic environment. Furthermore,
      we reveal differences in the composition of the sponge associated bacterial
      assemblages between Antarctic and tropical-temperate environments and the
      presence of a highly complex microbial eukaryote community, suggesting a
      particular signature for Antarctic sponges, different to that reported from other
      ecosystems.

LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiv115 [doi]
LID - fiv115 [pii]
AB  - Marine sponges host bacterial communities with important ecological and economic 
      roles in nature and society, yet these benefits depend largely on the stability
      of host-symbiont interactions and their susceptibility to changing environmental 
      conditions. Here, we investigated the temporal stability of complex host-microbe 
      symbioses in a temperate, seasonal environment over three years, targeting
      sponges across a range of symbiont density (high and low microbial abundance, HMA
      and LMA) and host taxonomy (six orders). Symbiont profiling by terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences
      revealed that bacterial communities in all sponges exhibited a high degree of
      host specificity, low seasonal dynamics and low interannual variability: results 
      that represent an emerging trend in the field of sponge microbiology and contrast
      sharply with the seasonal dynamics of free-living bacterioplankton. Further, HMA 
      sponges hosted more diverse, even and similar symbiont communities than LMA
      sponges and these differences in community structure extended to core members of 
      the microbiome. Together, these findings show clear distinctions in symbiont
      structure between HMA and LMA sponges while resolving notable similarities in
      their stability over seasonal and inter-annual scales, thus providing insight
      into the ecological consequences of the HMA-LMA dichotomy and the temporal
      stability of complex host-microbe symbioses.

AB  - Coccolithophores are unicellular calcifying marine phytoplankton that can form
      large and conspicuous blooms in the oceans and make significant contributions to 
      oceanic carbon cycling and atmospheric CO2 regulation. Despite their importance, 
      the bacterial diversity associated with these algae has not been explored for
      ecological or biotechnological reasons. Bacterial membership of Emiliania huxleyi
      and Coccolithus pelagicus f. braarudii cultures was assessed using cultivation
      and cultivation-independent methods. The communities were species rich compared
      to other phytoplankton cultures. Community analysis identified specific taxa
      which cooccur in all cultures (Marinobacter and Marivita). Hydrocarbon-degrading 
      bacteria were found in all cultures. The presence of Acidobacteria,
      Acidimicrobidae, Schlegelella, and Thermomonas was unprecedented but were
      potentially explained by calcification associated with coccolith production. One 
      strain of Acidobacteria was cultivated and is closely related to a marine
      Acidobacteria isolated from a sponge. From this assessment of the bacterial
      diversity of coccolithophores, a number of biotechnological opportunities are
      evident, from bioprospecting for novel taxa such as Acidobacteria to helping
      understand the relationship between obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria
      occurrence with phytoplankton and to revealing bacterial taxa that have a
      specific association with algae and may be suitable candidates as a means to
      improve the efficiency of mass algal cultivation.

AB  - Molasses wastewater contains high levels of organic compounds, cations, and
      anions, causing operational problems for anaerobic biological treatment. To
      establish a high organic loading treatment system for industrial molasses
      wastewater, this study designed a combined system comprising an acidification
      tank, a thermophilic multi-stage (MS)-upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)
      reactor, mesophilic UASB reactor, and down-flow hanging sponge reactor. The
      average total chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand removal 
      rates were 85%+/-3% and 95%+/-2%, respectively, at an organic loading rate of
      42kgCODcrm(-3)d(-1) in the MS-UASB reactor. By installation of the acidification 
      tank, the MS-UASB reactor achieved low H2-partial pressure. The abundance of
      syntrophs such as fatty acid-degrading bacteria increased in the MS-UASB and
      2nd-UASB reactors. Thus, the acidification tank contributed to maintaining a
      favorable environment for syntrophic associations. This study provides new
      information regarding microbial community composition in a molasses wastewater
      treatment system.

LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiv067 [doi]
LID - fiv067 [pii]
AB  - The siphonous algae of the Caulerpa genus harbor internal microbial communities
      hypothesized to play important roles in development, defense and metabolic
      activities of the host. Here, we characterize the endophytic bacterial community 
      of four Caulerpa taxa in the Mediterranean Sea, through 16S rRNA amplicon
      sequencing. Results reveal a striking alpha diversity of the bacterial
      communities, similar to levels found in sponges and coral holobionts. These
      comprise (1) a very small core community shared across all hosts (< 1% of the
      total community), (2) a variable portion (ca. 25%) shared by some Caulerpa taxa
      but not by all, which might represent environmentally acquired bacteria and (3) a
      large (>70%) species-specific fraction of the community, forming very specific
      clusters revealed by modularity in networks of cooccurrence, even in areas where 
      distinct Caulerpa taxa occurred in sympatry. Indirect inferences based on
      sequence homology suggest that these communities may play an important role in
      the metabolism of their host, in particular on their ability to grow on anoxic
      sediment. These findings support the hologenome theory and the need for a
      holistic framework in ecological and evolutionary studies of these holobionts
      that frequently become invasive.

TI  - Pyrosequencing characterization of the microbiota from Atlantic intertidal marine
      sponges reveals high microbial diversity and the lack of co-occurrence patterns.
PG  - e0127455
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0127455 [doi]
AB  - Sponges are ancient metazoans that host diverse and complex microbial
      communities. Sponge-associated microbial diversity has been studied from wide
      oceans across the globe, particularly in subtidal regions, but the microbial
      communities from intertidal sponges have remained mostly unexplored. Here we used
      pyrosequencing to characterize the microbial communities in 12 different
      co-occurring intertidal marine sponge species sampled from the Atlantic coast,
      revealing a total of 686 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence
      similarity. Taxonomic assignment of 16S ribosomal RNA tag sequences estimated
      altogether 26 microbial groups, represented by bacterial (75.5%) and archaeal
      (22%) domains. Proteobacteria (43.4%) and Crenarchaeota (20.6%) were the most
      dominant microbial groups detected in all the 12 marine sponge species and
      ambient seawater. The Crenarchaeota microbes detected in three Atlantic Ocean
      sponges had a close similarity with Crenarchaeota from geographically separated
      subtidal Red Sea sponges. Our study showed that most of the microbial communities
      observed in sponges (73%) were also found in the surrounding ambient seawater
      suggesting possible environmental acquisition and/or horizontal transfer of
      microbes. Beyond the microbial diversity and community structure assessments
      (NMDS, ADONIS, ANOSIM), we explored the interactions between the microbial
      communities coexisting in sponges using the checkerboard score (C-score).
      Analyses of the microbial association pattern (co-occurrence) among intertidal
      sympatric sponges revealed the random association of microbes, favoring the
      hypothesis that the sponge-inhabiting microbes are recruited from the habitat
      mostly by chance or influenced by environmental factors to benefit the hosts.

TI  - Transcriptional activity of the giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta Holobiont:
      molecular evidence for metabolic interchange.
PG  - 364
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2015.00364 [doi]
AB  - Compared to our understanding of the taxonomic composition of the symbiotic
      microbes in marine sponges, the functional diversity of these symbionts is
      largely unknown. Furthermore, the application of genomic, transcriptomic, and
      proteomic techniques to functional questions on sponge host-symbiont interactions
      is in its infancy. In this study, we generated a transcriptome for the host and a
      metatranscriptome of its microbial symbionts for the giant barrel sponge,
      Xestospongia muta, from the Caribbean. In combination with a gene-specific
      approach, our goals were to (1) characterize genetic evidence for nitrogen
      cycling in X. muta, an important limiting nutrient on coral reefs (2) identify
      which prokaryotic symbiont lineages are metabolically active and, (3)
      characterize the metabolic potential of the prokaryotic community. Xestospongia
      muta expresses genes from multiple nitrogen transformation pathways that when
      combined with the abundance of this sponge, and previous data on dissolved
      inorganic nitrogen fluxes, shows that this sponge is an important contributor to 
      nitrogen cycling biogeochemistry on coral reefs. Additionally, we observed
      significant differences in gene expression of the archaeal amoA gene, which is
      involved in ammonia oxidation, between coral reef locations consistent with
      differences in the fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen previously reported. In
      regards to symbiont metabolic potential, the genes in the biosynthetic pathways
      of several amino acids were present in the prokaryotic metatranscriptome dataset 
      but in the host-derived transcripts only the catabolic reactions for these amino 
      acids were present. A similar pattern was observed for the B vitamins
      (riboflavin, biotin, thiamin, cobalamin). These results expand our understanding 
      of biogeochemical cycling in sponges, and the metabolic interchange highlighted
      here advances the field of symbiont physiology by elucidating specific metabolic 
      pathways where there is high potential for host-prokaryote interactions.

AB  - Sponges are one of the most complex symbiotic communities and while the taxonomic
      composition of associated microbes has been determined, the biggest challenge now
      is to uncover their functional role in symbiosis. We investigated the microbiota 
      of two widely distributed sponge species, regarding both their taxonomic
      composition and their functional roles. Samples of Didiscus oxeata and Scopalina 
      ruetzleri were collected in the oceanic archipelago of St Peter and St Paul and
      analysed through metagenomics. Sequences generated by 454 pyrosequencing and Ion 
      Torrent were taxonomically and functionally annotated on the MG-RAST server using
      the GenBank and SEED databases, respectively. Both communities exhibit
      equivalence in core functions, interestingly played by the most abundant taxa in 
      each community. Conversely, the microbial communities differ in composition,
      taxonomic diversity and potential metabolic strategies. Functional annotation
      indirectly suggests differences in preferential pathways of carbon, nitrogen and 
      sulphur metabolisms, which may indicate different metabolic strategies.

TI  - Bacterial community composition and predicted functional ecology of sponges,

LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiv019 [doi]
LID - fiv019 [pii]
AB  - In the present study, we assessed the composition of Bacteria in four biotopes
      namely sediment, seawater and two sponge species (Stylissa massa and Xestospongia
      testudinaria) at four different reef sites in a coral reef ecosystem in West
      Java, Indonesia. In addition to this, we used a predictive metagenomic approach
      to estimate to what extent nitrogen metabolic pathways differed among bacterial
      communities from different biotopes. We observed marked differences in bacterial 
      composition of the most abundant bacterial phyla, classes and orders among sponge
      species, water and sediment. Proteobacteria were by far the most abundant phylum 
      in terms of both sequences and Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Predicted
      counts for genes associated with the nitrogen metabolism suggested that several
      genes involved in the nitrogen cycle were enriched in sponge samples, including
      nosZ, nifD, nirK, norB and nrfA genes. Our data show that a combined barcoded
      pyrosequencing and predictive metagenomic approach can provide novel insights
      into the potential ecological functions of the microbial communities. Not only is
      this approach useful for our understanding of the vast microbial diversity found 
      in sponges but also to understand the potential response of microbial communities
      to environmental change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Marine invertebrate-associated microbial communities are interesting 
      examples of complex symbiotic systems and are a potential source of
      biotechnological products. RESULTS: In this work, pyrosequencing-based assessment
      from bacterial community structures of sediments, two sponges, and one zoanthid
      collected in the Mexican Caribbean was performed. The results suggest that the
      bacterial diversity at the species level is higher in the sediments than in the
      animal samples. Analysis of bacterial communities' structure showed that about
      two thirds of the bacterial diversity in all the samples belongs to the phyla
      Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria. The genus Acidobacterium appears to dominate
      the bacterial community in all the samples, reaching almost 80% in the sponge
      Hyrtios. CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence suggests that the sympatric location of these 
      benthonic species may lead to common bacterial structure features among their
      bacterial communities. The results may serve as a first insight to formulate
      hypotheses that lead to more extensive studies of sessile marine organisms'
      microbiomes from the Mexican Caribbean.

AB  - The anaerobic-anoxic sequence batch reactor (A2SBR) was applied to achieve
      nitrogen and phosphorus removal in an energy-saving sewage treatment system
      involving an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket combined with a down-flow hanging
      sponge reactor to treat municipal sewage. After sludge acclimation, the A2SBR
      showed satisfactory denitrification and phosphorus removal performance with total
      phosphate and nitrate concentrations of the effluent of 8.4 +/- 3.4 mg-N L(-)(1) 
      and 0.9 +/- 0.6 mg-P L(-)(1), respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequence and
      fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses revealed that 'Candidatus
      Accumulibacter phosphatis' was the dominant phosphate-accumulating
      micro-organism. Although a competitive bacterium for polyphosphate-accumulating
      organisms, 'Ca. Competibacter phosphatis', was not detected, Dechloromonas spp.
      were abundant. The ppk1 gene sequence analysis showed that the type II lineage of
      'Ca. Accumulibacter' was dominant. The results suggest that denitrification and
      phosphorus removal in the A2SBR could be achieved by cooperative activity of 'Ca.
      Accumulibacter' and nitrate-reducing bacteria.

AB  - A two-stage closed downflow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor was used as a
      post-treatment to prevent methane being emitted from upflow anaerobic sludge
      blanket (UASB) effluents containing unrecovered dissolved methane. The
      performance of the closed DHS reactor was evaluated using real municipal sewage
      at ambient temperatures (10-28 degrees C) for one year. The first stage of the
      closed DHS reactor was intended to recover dissolved methane from the UASB
      effluent and produce a burnable gas with a methane concentration greater than
      30%, and its recovery efficiency was 57-88%, although the amount of dissolved
      methane in the UASB effluent fluctuated in the range of 46-68 % of methane
      production greatly depending on the temperature. The residual methane was
      oxidized and the remaining organic carbon was removed in the second closed DHS
      reactor, and this reactor performed very well, removing more than 99% of the
      dissolved methane during the experimental period. The rate at which air was
      supplied to the DHS reactor was found to be one of the most important operating
      parameters. Microbial community analysis revealed that seasonal changes in the
      methane-oxidizing bacteria were key to preventing methane emissions.

      aquarium biofilters.
PG  - e113515
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0113515 [doi]
AB  - Nitrifying biofilters are used in aquaria and aquaculture systems to prevent
      accumulation of ammonia by promoting rapid conversion to nitrate via nitrite.
      Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), as opposed to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), 
      were recently identified as the dominant ammonia oxidizers in most freshwater
      aquaria. This study investigated biofilms from fixed-bed aquarium biofilters to
      assess the temporal and spatial dynamics of AOA and AOB abundance and diversity. 
      Over a period of four months, ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms from six
      freshwater and one marine aquarium were investigated at 4-5 time points. Nitrogen
      balances for three freshwater aquaria showed that active nitrification by
      aquarium biofilters accounted for >/= 81-86% of total nitrogen conversion in the 
      aquaria. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) for bacterial and thaumarchaeal ammonia
      monooxygenase (amoA) genes demonstrated that AOA were numerically dominant over
      AOB in all six freshwater aquaria tested, and contributed all detectable amoA
      genes in three aquarium biofilters. In the marine aquarium, however, AOB
      outnumbered AOA by three to five orders of magnitude based on amoA gene
      abundances. A comparison of AOA abundance in three carrier materials (fine
      sponge, rough sponge and sintered glass or ceramic rings) of two three-media
      freshwater biofilters revealed preferential growth of AOA on fine sponge.
      Denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) of thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA genes
      indicated that community composition within a given biofilter was stable across
      media types. In addition, DGGE of all aquarium biofilters revealed low AOA
      diversity, with few bands, which were stable over time. Nonmetric
      multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
      (DGGE) fingerprints of thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA genes placed freshwater and marine 
      aquaria communities in separate clusters. These results indicate that AOA are the
      dominant ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in freshwater aquarium biofilters, and 
      that AOA community composition within a given aquarium is stable over time and
      across biofilter support material types.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2014.00611 [doi]
AB  - Complex and distinct bacterial communities inhabit marine sponges and are
      believed to be essential to host survival, but our present-day inability to
      domesticate sponge symbionts in the laboratory hinders our access to the full
      metabolic breadth of these microbial consortia. We address bacterial cultivation 
      bias in marine sponges using a procedure that enables direct comparison between
      cultivated and uncultivated symbiont community structures. Bacterial community
      profiling of the sympatric keratose species Sarcotragus spinosulus and Ircinia
      variabilis (Dictyoceratida, Irciniidae) was performed by polymerase chain
      reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 454-pyrosequecing of 16S
      rRNA gene fragments. Whereas cultivation-independent methods revealed
      species-specific bacterial community structures in these hosts,
      cultivation-dependent methods resulted in equivalent community assemblages from
      both species. Between 15 and 18 bacterial phyla were found in S. spinosulus and
      I. variabilis using cultivation-independent methods. However, Alphaproteobacteria
      and Gammaproteobacteria dominated the cultivation-dependent bacterial community. 
      While cultivation-independent methods revealed about 200 and 220 operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% gene similarity) in S. spinosulus and I. variabilis,
      respectively, only 33 and 39 OTUs were found in these species via culturing.
      Nevertheless, around 50% of all cultured OTUs escaped detection by
      cultivation-independent methods, indicating that standard cultivation makes
      otherwise host-specific bacterial communities similar by selectively enriching
      for rarer and generalist symbionts. This study sheds new light on the diversity
      spectrum encompassed by cultivated and uncultivated sponge-associated bacteria.
      Moreover, it highlights the need to develop alternative culturing technologies to
      capture the dominant sponge symbiont fraction that currently remains recalcitrant
      to laboratory manipulation.

TI  - Spatial changes in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of sludge and
      associated organisms in a biological sewage treatment system.
PG  - 387-93
AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(1)(3)C and delta(1)(5)N) have
      been utilized as powerful tools for tracing energy or material flows within food 
      webs in a range of environmental studies. However, the techniques have rarely
      been applied to the study of biological wastewater treatment technologies. We
      report on the spatial changes in delta(1)(3)C and delta(1)(5)N in sludge and its 
      associated biotic community in a wastewater treatment system. This system
      consisted of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and a down-flow hanging
      sponge (DHS) which is a novel type of trickling filter. The results showed clear 
      spatial changes in the delta(1)(3)C and delta(1)(5)N of suspended solids (SS),
      retained sludge, and macrofauna (oligochaetes and fly larvae) in the system. The 
      delta(1)(3)C and delta(1)(5)N was used as a natural tracer to determine the SS
      dynamic throughout the system. The results imply that SS in the DHS effluent was 
      mainly eluted from the retained sludge in the lower section of the DHS reactor.
      The delta(1)(5)N of the retained sludge in the DHS reactor increased drastically 
      from the inlet towards to the outlet, from -0.7 per thousand to 10.3 per
      thousand. This phenomenon may be attributed to nitrogen conversion processes
      (i.e. nitrification and denitrification). The delta(1)(5)N of oligochaetes also
      increased from the inlet to the outlet, which corresponded well to that of the
      retained sludge. Thus, the delta(1)(5)N of the oligochaetes might simply mirror
      the delta(1)(5)N of the retained sludge. On the other hand, the delta(1)(3)C and 
      delta(1)(5)N of sympatric fly larvae differed from those of the oligochaetes
      sampled, indicating dietary differences between the taxa. Therefore delta(1)(3)C 
      and delta(1)(5)N reflected both treatment and dietary characteristics. We
      concluded that delta(1)(3)C and delta(1)(5)N values are potentially useful as
      alternative indicators for investigating microbial ecosystems and treatment
      characteristics of biological wastewater treatment systems.

TI  - The putative functional ecology and distribution of archaeal communities in
      sponges, sediment and seawater in a coral reef environment.

AB  - Archaea play crucial roles in a number of key ecological processes including
      nitrification and methanogenesis. Although several studies have been conducted on
      these organisms, the roles and dynamics of coral reef archaeal communities are
      still poorly understood, particularly in host and nonhost biotopes and in high
      (HMA) and low microbial abundance (LMA) sponges. Here, archaeal communities
      detected in six distinct biotopes, namely, sediment, seawater and four different 
      sponge species Stylissa carteri, Stylissa massa, Xestospongia testudinaria and
      Hyrtios erectus from the Spermonde Archipelago, SW Sulawesi, Indonesia were
      investigated using 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes (OTU cut-off 97%).
      Archaeal communities from sediment and sponges were dominated by Crenarchaeota,
      while the seawater community was dominated by Euryarchaeota. The biotope
      explained almost 75% of the variation in archaeal composition, with clear
      separation between microbial assemblages from sediment, X. testudinaria and H.
      erectus (HMA). In contrast, samples from seawater and both Stylissa species (LMA)
      showed considerable overlap in the ordination and, furthermore, shared most
      abundant OTUs with the exception of a single dominant OTU specifically enriched
      in both Stylissa species. Predicted functional gene content in archaeal
      assemblages also revealed significant differences among biotopes. Different
      ammonia assimilation strategies were exhibited by the archaeal communities: X.
      testudinaria, H. erectus and sediment archaeal communities were enriched for
      glutamate dehydrogenase with mixed specificity (NAD(P)(+) ) pathways, while
      archaeal planktonic communities were enriched for specific glutamate
      dehydrogenase (NADP(+) ) and glutamate synthase pathways. Archaeal communities in
      Stylissa had intermediate levels of enrichment. Our results indicate that
      archaeal communities in different biotopes have distinct ecophysiological roles.

PG  - 563
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2014.00563 [doi]
AB  - The genus Vibrio is a metabolically diverse group of facultative anaerobic
      bacteria, common in aquatic environments and marine hosts. The genus contains
      several species of importance to human health and aquaculture, including the
      causative agents of human cholera and fish vibriosis. Vibrios display a wide
      variety of known life histories, from opportunistic pathogens to long-standing
      symbionts with individual host species. Studying Vibrio ecology has been
      challenging as individual species often display a wide range of habitat
      preferences, and groups of vibrios can act as socially cohesive groups. Although 
      strong associations with salinity, temperature and other environmental variables 
      have been established, the degree of habitat or host specificity at both the
      individual and community levels is unknown. Here we use oligotyping analyses in
      combination with a large collection of existing Vibrio 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
      gene sequence data to reveal patterns of Vibrio ecology across a wide range of
      environmental, host, and abiotic substrate associated habitats. Our data show
      that individual taxa often display a wide range of habitat preferences yet tend
      to be highly abundant in either substrate-associated or free-living environments.
      Our analyses show that Vibrio communities share considerable overlap between two 
      distinct hosts (i.e., sponge and fish), yet are distinct from the abiotic plastic
      substrates. Lastly, evidence for habitat specificity at the community level
      exists in some habitats, despite considerable stochasticity in others. In
      addition to providing insights into Vibrio ecology across a broad range of
      habitats, our study shows the utility of oligotyping as a facile, high-throughput
      and unbiased method for large-scale analyses of publically available sequence
      data repositories and suggests its wide application could greatly extend the
      range of possibilities to explore microbial ecology.

TI  - Antibiotic activity and microbial community of the temperate sponge, Haliclona
      sp.
PG  - 419-30
LID - 10.1111/jam.12709 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Sessile marine invertebrates engage in a diverse array of beneficial
      interactions with bacterial symbionts. One feature of some of these relationships
      is the presence of bioactive natural products that can defend the holobiont from 
      predation, competition or disease. In this study, we investigated the
      antimicrobial activity and microbial community of a common temperate sponge from 
      coastal North Carolina. METHODS AND RESULTS: The sponge was identified as a
      member of the genus Haliclona, a prolific source of bioactive natural products,
      based on its 18S rRNA gene sequence. The crude chemical extract and methanol
      partition had broad activity against the assayed Gram-negative and Gram-positive 
      pathogenic bacteria. Further fractionation resulted in two groups of compounds
      with differing antimicrobial activity, primarily against Gram-positive test
      organisms. There was, however, notable activity against the Gram-negative marine 
      pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Microbial community analysis of the sponge and
      surrounding sea water via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
      indicates that it harbours a distinct group of bacterial associates. CONCLUSIONS:
      The common temperate sponge, Haliclona sp., is a source of multiple antimicrobial
      compounds and has some consistent microbial community members that may play a
      role in secondary metabolite production. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:
      These data suggest that common temperate sponges can be a source of bioactive
      chemical and microbial diversity. Further studies may reveal the importance of
      the microbial associates to the sponge and natural product biosynthesis.

TI  - Two distinct microbial communities revealed in the sponge Cinachyrella.
PG  - 581
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2014.00581 [doi]
AB  - Marine sponges are vital components of benthic and coral reef ecosystems,
      providing shelter and nutrition for many organisms. In addition, sponges act as
      an essential carbon and nutrient link between the pelagic and benthic environment
      by filtering large quantities of seawater. Many sponge species harbor a diverse
      microbial community (including Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryotes), which can
      constitute up to 50% of the sponge biomass. Sponges of the genus Cinachyrella are
      common in Caribbean and Floridian reefs and their archaeal and bacterial
      microbiomes were explored here using 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing.
      Cinachyrella specimens and seawater samples were collected from the same South
      Florida reef at two different times of year. In total, 639 OTUs (12 archaeal and 
      627 bacterial) belonging to 2 archaeal and 21 bacterial phyla were detected in
      the sponges. Based on their microbiomes, the six sponge samples formed two
      distinct groups, namely sponge group 1 (SG1) with lower diversity (Shannon-Weiner
      index: 3.73 +/- 0.22) and SG2 with higher diversity (Shannon-Weiner index: 5.95
      +/- 0.25). Hosts' 28S rRNA gene sequences further confirmed that the sponge
      specimens were composed of two taxa closely related to Cinachyrella kuekenthalli.
      Both sponge groups were dominated by Proteobacteria, but Alphaproteobacteria were
      significantly more abundant in SG1. SG2 harbored many bacterial phyla (>1% of
      sequences) present in low abundance or below detection limits (<0.07%) in SG1
      including: Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, PAUC34f,
      Poribacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Furthermore, SG1 and SG2 only had 95 OTUs in
      common, representing 30.5 and 22.4% of SG1 and SG2's total OTUs, respectively.
      These results suggest that the sponge host may exert a pivotal influence on the
      nature and structure of the microbial community and may only be marginally
      affected by external environment parameters.

AB  - Sponges that harbor microalgal or, cyanobacterial symbionts may benefit from
      photosynthetically derived carbohydrates, which are rich in carbon but devoid of 
      nitrogen, and may therefore encounter nitrogen limitation. Diazotrophic
      communities associated with two Caribbean sponges, Ircinia strobilina and Mycale 
      laxissima were studied in a time series during which three individuals of each
      sponge were collected in four time points (5:00 AM, 12:00 noon, 5:00 PM, 10:00
      PM). nifH genes were successfully amplified from the corresponding gDNA and cDNA 
      pools and sequenced by high throughput 454 amplicon sequencing. In both sponges, 
      over half the nifH transcripts were classified as from cyanobacteria and the
      remainder from heterotrophic bacteria. We found various groups of bacteria
      actively expressing the nifH gene during the entire day-night cycle, an
      indication that the nitrogen fixation potential was fully exploited by different 
      nitrogen fixing bacteria groups associated with their hosts. This study showed
      for the first time the dynamic changes in the activity of the diazotrophic
      bacterial communities in marine sponges. Our study expands understanding of the
      diazotrophic groups that contribute to the fixed nitrogen pool in the benthic
      community. Sponge bacterial community-associated diazotrophy may have an
      important impact on the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle in the coral reef
      ecosystem.

AB  - Sponges (Porifera) can host diverse and abundant communities of microbial
      symbionts that make crucial contributions to host metabolism. Although these
      communities are often host-specific and hypothesized to co-evolve with their
      hosts, correlations between host phylogeny and microbiome community structure are
      rarely tested. As part of the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP), we surveyed the
      microbiomes associated with 20 species of tropical marine sponges collected over 
      a narrow geographic range. We tested whether (1) univariate metrics of microbiome
      diversity displayed significant phylogenetic signal across the host phylogeny;
      (2) host identity and host phylogeny were significant factors in multivariate
      analyses of taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity; and (3) different minimum
      read thresholds impacted these results. We observed significant differences in
      univariate metrics of diversity among host species for all read thresholds, with 
      strong phylogenetic signal in the inverse Simpson's index of diversity (D). We
      observed a surprisingly wide range of variability in community dissimilarity
      within host species (4-73%); this variability was not related to microbial
      abundance within a host species. Taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity were
      significantly impacted by host identity and host phylogeny when these factors
      were considered individually; when tested together, the effect of host phylogeny 
      was reduced, but remained significant. In our dataset, this outcome is largely
      due to closely related host sponges harboring distinct microbial taxa. Host
      identity maintained a strong statistical signal at all minimum read thresholds.
      Although the identity of specific microbial taxa varied substantially among host 
      sponges, closely related hosts tended to harbor microbial communities with
      similar patterns of relative abundance. We hypothesize that microbiomes with low 
      D might be structured by regulation of the microbial community by the host or by 
      the presence of competitively dominant symbionts that are themselves under
      selection for host specificity.

AB  - Compared with the knowledge of sponge-associated bacterial diversity and
      ecological roles, the fungal diversity and ecological roles of sponges remain
      largely unknown. In this study, the fungal diversity and protein synthesis
      potential in two South China Sea sponges Theonella swinhoei and Xestospongia
      testudinaria were investigated by rRNA vs. rRNA gene analysis. EF4/fung5 was
      chosen after a series of PCR tests to target fungal 18S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene.
      Altogether, 283 high-quality sequences were obtained, which resulted in 26
      Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were assigned to Ascomycota,
      Basidiomycota, and Blastocladiomycota. At subphylum level, 77.3% of
      sponge-derived sequences were affiliated with Pezizomycotina. The fungal
      compositions of T. swinhoei and X. testudinaria were different from that of
      ambient seawater. The predominant OTU shared between two sponges was rare in
      seawater, whereas the most abundant OTUs in seawater were not found in sponges.
      Additionally, the major OTUs of sponge cDNA datasets were shared in two sponges. 
      The fungal diversity illustrated by sponge cDNA datasets correlated well with
      that derived from sponge DNA datasets, indicating that the major members of
      sponge-associated fungi had protein synthesis potential. This study highlighted
      the diversity of Pezizomycotina in marine sponge-fungi symbioses and the
      necessity of investigating ecological roles of sponge-associated fungi.

TI  - Natural volcanic CO2 seeps reveal future trajectories for host-microbial
      associations in corals and sponges.
PG  - 894-908
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2014.188 [doi]
AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are rapidly rising causing an increase in
      the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the ocean and a reduction in pH known as
      ocean acidification (OA). Natural volcanic seeps in Papua New Guinea expel 99%
      pure CO2 and thereby offer a unique opportunity to explore the effects of OA in
      situ. The corals Acropora millepora and Porites cylindrica were less abundant and
      hosted significantly different microbial communities at the CO2 seep than at
      nearby control sites <500 m away. A primary driver of microbial differences in A.
      millepora was a 50% reduction of symbiotic Endozoicomonas. This loss of symbiotic
      taxa from corals at the CO2 seep highlights a potential hurdle for corals to
      overcome if they are to adapt to and survive OA. In contrast, the two sponges
      Coelocarteria singaporensis and Cinachyra sp. were approximately 40-fold more
      abundant at the seep and hosted a significantly higher relative abundance of
      Synechococcus than sponges at control sites. The increase in photosynthetic
      microbes at the seep potentially provides these species with a nutritional
      benefit and enhanced scope for growth under future climate scenarios (thus,
      flexibility in symbiosis may lead to a larger niche breadth). The microbial
      community in the apparently pCO2-sensitive sponge species S. massa was not
      significantly different between sites. These data show that responses to elevated
      pCO2 are species-specific and that the stability and flexibility of microbial
      partnerships may have an important role in shaping and contributing to the
      fitness and success of some hosts.

TI  - GeoChip-based insights into the microbial functional gene repertoire of marine
      sponges (high microbial abundance, low microbial abundance) and seawater.
PG  - 832-43
LID - 10.1111/1574-6941.12441 [doi]
AB  - The GeoChip 4.2 gene array was employed to interrogate the microbial functional
      gene repertoire of sponges and seawater collected from the Red Sea and the
      Mediterranean. Complementary amplicon sequencing confirmed the microbial
      community composition characteristic of high microbial abundance (HMA) and low
      microbial abundance (LMA) sponges. By use of GeoChip, altogether 20,273 probes
      encoding for 627 functional genes and representing 16 gene categories were
      identified. Minimum curvilinear embedding analyses revealed a clear separation
      between the samples. The HMA/LMA dichotomy was stronger than any possible
      geographic pattern, which is shown here for the first time on the level of
      functional genes. However, upon inspection of individual genes, very few specific
      differences were discernible. Differences were related to microbial ammonia
      oxidation, ammonification, and archaeal autotrophic carbon fixation (higher gene 
      abundance in sponges over seawater) as well as denitrification and
      radiation-stress-related genes (lower gene abundance in sponges over seawater).
      Except for few documented specific differences the functional gene repertoire
      between the different sources appeared largely similar. This study expands
      previous reports in that functional gene convergence is not only reported between
      HMA and LMA sponges but also between sponges and seawater.

LID - 54 [pii]
AB  - Sponges have generated significant interest as a source of bioactive and
      elaborate secondary metabolites that hold promise for the development of novel
      therapeutics for the control of an array of human diseases. However, research and
      development of marine natural products can often be hampered by the difficulty
      associated with obtaining a stable and sustainable production source. Herein we
      report the first successful characterization and utilization of the microbiome of
      a marine invertebrate to identify a sustainable production source for an
      important natural product scaffold. Through molecular-microbial community
      analysis, optimization of fermentation conditions and MALDI-MS imaging, we
      provide the first report of a sponge-associated bacterium (Micromonospora sp.)
      that produces the manzamine class of antimalarials from the Indo-Pacific sponge
      Acanthostrongylophora ingens (Thiele, 1899) (Class Demospongiae, Order
      Haplosclerida, Family Petrosiidae). These findings suggest that a general
      strategy of analysis of the macroorganism's microbiome could significantly
      transform the field of natural products drug discovery by gaining access to not
      only novel drug leads, but the potential for sustainable production sources and
      biosynthetic genes at the same time.

AB  - Archaea associated with marine sponges are active and influence the nitrogen
      metabolism of sponges. However, we know little about their occurrence,
      specificity, and persistence. We aimed to elucidate the relative importance of
      host specificity and biogeographic background in shaping the symbiotic archaeal
      communities. We investigated these communities in sympatric sponges from the
      Mediterranean (Ircinia fasciculata and Ircinia oros, sampled in summer and
      winter) and from the Caribbean (Ircinia strobilina and Mycale laxissima). PCR
      cloning and sequencing of archaeal 16S rRNA and amoA genes showed that the
      archaeal community composition and structure were different from that in seawater
      and varied among sponge species. We found that the communities were dominated by 
      ammonia-oxidizing archaea closely related to Nitrosopumilus. The community in M. 
      laxissima differed from that in Ircinia spp., including the sympatric sponge I.
      strobilina; yet, geographical clusters within Ircinia spp. were observed. Whereas
      archaeal phylotypes in Ircinia spp. were persistent and belong to
      'sponge-enriched' clusters, archaea in M. laxissima were closely related with
      those from diverse habitats (i.e. seawater and sediments). For all four sponge
      species, the expression of the archaeal amoA gene was confirmed. Our results
      indicate that host-specific processes, such as host ecological strategy and
      evolutionary history, control the sponge-archaeal communities.

AB  - The present work aimed to investigate the diversity of bacteria and filamentous
      fungi of southern Atlantic Ocean marine sponge Dragmacidon reticulatum using
      cultivation-independent approaches. Fungal ITS rDNA and 18S gene analyses (DGGE
      and direct sequencing approaches) showed the presence of representatives of three
      order (Polyporales, Malasseziales, and Agaricales) from the phylum Basidiomycota 
      and seven orders belonging to the phylum Ascomycota (Arthoniales, Capnodiales,
      Dothideales, Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Pleosporales, and Saccharomycetales). On
      the other hand, bacterial 16S rDNA gene analyses by direct sequencing approach
      revealed the presence of representatives of seven bacterial phyla (Cyanobacteria,
      Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Lentisphaerae, Chloroflexi, and
      Planctomycetes). Results from statistical analyses (rarefaction curves) suggested
      that the sampled clones covered the fungal diversity in the sponge samples
      studied, while for the bacterial community additional sampling would be necessary
      for saturation. This is the first report related to the molecular analyses of
      fungal and bacterial communities by cultivation-independent approaches in the
      marine sponges D. reticulatum. Additionally, the present work broadening the
      knowledge of microbial diversity associated to marine sponges and reports
      innovative data on the presence of some fungal genera in marine samples.

TI  - A long-term cultivation of an anaerobic methane-oxidizing microbial community
      from deep-sea methane-seep sediment using a continuous-flow bioreactor.

AB  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in marine sediments is an important global
      methane sink, but the physiological characteristics of AOM-associated
      microorganisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the cultivation of an AOM
      microbial community from deep-sea methane-seep sediment using a continuous-flow
      bioreactor with polyurethane sponges, called the down-flow hanging sponge (DHS)
      bioreactor. We anaerobically incubated deep-sea methane-seep sediment collected
      from the Nankai Trough, Japan, for 2,013 days in the bioreactor at 10 degrees C. 
      Following incubation, an active AOM activity was confirmed by a tracer experiment
      using 13C-labeled methane. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that
      phylogenetically diverse Archaea and Bacteria grew in the bioreactor. After 2,013
      days of incubation, the predominant archaeal components were anaerobic
      methanotroph (ANME)-2a, Deep-Sea Archaeal Group, and Marine Benthic Group-D, and 
      Gammaproteobacteria was the dominant bacterial lineage. Fluorescence in situ
      hybridization analysis showed that ANME-1 and -2a, and most ANME-2c cells
      occurred without close physical interaction with potential bacterial partners.
      Our data demonstrate that the DHS bioreactor system is a useful system for
      cultivating fastidious methane-seep-associated sedimentary microorganisms.

TI  - Application of a new cultivation technology, I-tip, for studying microbial

AB  - One of the fundamental methods for cultivating bacterial strains is conventional 
      plating on solid media, but this method does not reveal the true diversity of the
      bacterial community. In this study, we develop a new technique and introduce a
      new device we term, I-tip. The I-tip was developed as an in situ cultivation
      device that allows microorganisms to enter and natural chemical compounds to
      diffuse, thereby permitting the microorganisms to grow utilizing chemical
      compounds in their natural environment. The new method was used to cultivate
      microorganisms from Baikalian sponges, and the results were compared with
      conventional plating as well as a pyrosequencing-based molecular survey. The
      I-tip method produced cultures of 34 species from five major phyla,
      Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and
      Gammaproteobacteria, 'missing' only two major phyla detected by pyrosequencing.
      Meanwhile, standard cultivation produced a smaller collection of 16 species from 
      three major phyla, Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Gammaproteobacteria,
      failing to detect over half of the major phyla registered by pyrosequencing. We
      conclude that the I-tip method can narrow the gap between cultivated and
      uncultivated species, at least for some of the more challenging microbial
      communities such as those associated with animal hosts.

AB  - In spite of considerable insights into the microbial diversity of marine sponges,
      quantitative information on microbial abundances and community composition
      remains scarce. Here, we established qPCR assays for the specific quantification 
      of four bacterial phyla of representative sponge symbionts as well as the
      kingdoms Eubacteria and Archaea. We could show that the 16S rRNA gene numbers of 
      Archaea, Chloroflexi, and the candidate phylum Poribacteria were 4-6 orders of
      magnitude higher in high microbial abundance (HMA) than in low microbial
      abundance (LMA) sponges and that actinobacterial 16S rRNA gene numbers were 1-2
      orders higher in HMA over LMA sponges, while those for Cyanobacteria were stable 
      between HMA and LMA sponges. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of Aplysina
      aerophoba tissue sections confirmed the numerical dominance of Chloroflexi, which
      was followed by Poribacteria. Archaeal and actinobacterial cells were detected in
      much lower numbers. By use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting as a primer-
      and probe-independent approach, the dominance of Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, and
      Poribacteria in A. aerophoba was confirmed. Our study provides new quantitative
      insights into the microbiology of sponges and contributes to a better
      understanding of the HMA/LMA dichotomy.

      up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating municipal sewage.

AB  - A novel wastewater treatment system consisting of an up-flow anaerobic sludge
      blanket (UASB) reactor and a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor with
      sulfur-redox reaction was developed for treatment of municipal sewage under
      low-temperature conditions. In the UASB reactor, a novel phenomenon of anaerobic 
      sulfur oxidation occurred in the absence of oxygen, nitrite and nitrate as
      electron acceptors. The microorganisms involved in anaerobic sulfur oxidation
      have not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we studied the microbial
      communities existing in the UASB reactor that probably enhanced anaerobic sulfur 
      oxidation. Sludge samples collected from the UASB reactor before and after sulfur
      oxidation were used for cloning and terminal restriction fragment length
      polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacterial and
      archaeal domains. The microbial community structures of bacteria and archaea
      indicated that the genus Smithella and uncultured bacteria within the phylum
      Caldiserica were the dominant bacteria groups. Methanosaeta spp. was the dominant
      group of the domain archaea. The T-RFLP analysis, which was consistent with the
      cloning results, also yielded characteristic fingerprints for bacterial
      communities, whereas the archaeal community structure yielded stable microbial
      community. From these results, it can be presumed that these major bacteria
      groups, genus Smithella and uncultured bacteria within the phylum Caldiserica,
      probably play an important role in sulfur oxidation in UASB reactors.

TI  - Revealing microbial functional activities in the Red Sea sponge Stylissa carteri 
      by metatranscriptomics.
PG  - 3683-98
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.12533 [doi]
AB  - Sponges are important components of marine benthic environments and are
      associated with microbial symbionts that carry out ecologically relevant
      functions. Stylissa carteri is an abundant, low-microbial abundance species in
      the Red Sea. We aimed to achieve the functional and taxonomic characterization of
      the most actively expressed prokaryotic genes in S. carteri. Prokaryotic mRNA was
      enriched from sponge total RNA, sequenced using Illumina HiSeq technology and
      annotated using the metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology
      (MG-RAST) pipeline. We detected high expression of archaeal ammonia oxidation and
      photosynthetic carbon fixation by members of the genus Synechococcus. Functions
      related to stress response and membrane transporters were among the most highly
      expressed by S. carteri symbionts. Unexpectedly, gene functions related to
      methylotrophy were highly expressed by gammaproteobacterial symbionts. The
      presence of seawater-derived microbes is indicated by the phylogenetic proximity 
      of organic carbon transporters to orthologues of members from the SAR11 clade. In
      summary, we revealed the most expressed functions of the S. carteri-associated
      microbial community and linked them to the dominant taxonomic members of the
      microbiome. This work demonstrates the applicability of metatranscriptomics to
      explore poorly characterized symbiotic consortia and expands our knowledge of the
      ecologically relevant functions carried out by coral reef sponge symbionts.

PG  - 216
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2014.00216 [doi]
AB  - Levels of nitrogen in coastal areas have been rapidly increasing due to
      accumulative inputs of sewage and terrigenous sediments carrying fertilizers.
      Sponges have an immense filtering capacity and may be directly impacted
      (positively or negatively) by elevated concentrations of nitrogen. Sponges also
      host a wide diversity of microbes involved in nitrogen metabolism, yet little is 
      known about the effects of nitrogen loading on these symbiotic partnerships.
      Manipulative experiments were undertaken to examine the potential effects of
      excess nitrogen (up to 240 muM) on microbial symbiosis in the abundant sponge
      species Cymbastela stipitata. Microbial composition and activity were examined
      using 454-pyrotag sequencing of DNA- and RNA-derived samples. Despite the high
      levels of nitrogen exposure (up to 124-fold above ambient), sponges appeared
      visibly unaffected at all treatment concentrations. At the phylum level, the
      microbial community was consistent between all sponge samples regardless of
      nitrogen treatment, with Cyanobacteria and Thaumarchaeota being the dominant
      taxa. Higher microbial diversity was observed at the operational taxonomic units 
      (OTU) level (97% sequence similarity), with only 40% of OTUs shared between
      samples from all treatments. However, a single cyanobacterial OTU dominated the
      community of all individuals (average 73.5%) and this OTU did not vary with
      nitrogen treatment. The conserved microbial community in all sponges irrespective
      of nitrogen treatment highlights the stability of the sponge-microbe relationship
      and indicates that the holobiont is resistant to short pulses of nitrogen at
      levels mimicking sewage effluent.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of prokaryotic communities in the marine sponge Sarcotragus
      spinosulus.
PG  - 3097-112
LID - 10.1111/mec.12789 [doi]
AB  - In spite of their putative relevance to host functioning, in-depth knowledge of
      sponge microbiome stability over time is scarce. This study tackles the temporal 
      maintenance of bacterial and archaeal assemblages in the model host Sarcotragus
      spinosulus along three successive years. Prokaryotic communities were profiled by
      polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and 
      454-pyrosequencing of S. spinosulus-derived 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Prevailing
      bacterial phyla were Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Poribacteria,
      PAUC34f, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes, with Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and
      Poribacteria showing different abundances over the years. At the approximate
      species level (operational taxonomic units, OTUs, defined at 97% sequence
      similarity), no major changes in bacterial richness and composition were found
      through time. Nearly 50% of all detected bacterial symbionts (96 in 205 OTUs)
      were recovered from all sampling years, whereas a taxonomically equivalent
      community of less dominant bacteria characterized the transient sponge
      microbiota. Despite the evidence for temporal symbiont maintenance, an intriguing
      cumulative degree of variation between individuals was unravelled, with all the
      surveyed sponge specimens sharing only 27 bacterial OTUs. Archaeal communities
      were dominated by one single symbiont of the candidate genus Nitrosopumilus
      (Thaumarchaeota), known for its ability to aerobically oxidize ammonia to
      nitrite. Only few bacterial ammonia oxidizers consistently occurred in S.
      spinosulus across the years as documented by PCR-DGGE fingerprinting. In
      conclusion, prokaryotic symbionts of S. spinosulus display a state of dynamic
      stability shaped by the interplay between the maintenance of dominant players and
      turnover of less prevalent community members, in time and across host
      individuals, with no apparent consequences to holobiont functioning.

AB  - The microbiota of four individual deep water sponges, Lissodendoryx diversichela,
      Poecillastra compressa, Inflatella pellicula, and Stelletta normani, together
      with surrounding seawater were analysed by pyrosequencing of a region of the 16S 
      rRNA gene common to Bacteria and Archaea. Due to sampling constraints at depths
      below 700 m duplicate samples were not collected. The microbial communities of L.
      diversichela, P. compressa and I. pellicula were typical of low microbial
      abundance (LMA) sponges while S. normani had a community more typical of high
      microbial abundance (HMA) sponges. Analysis of the deep sea sponge microbiota
      revealed that the three LMA-like sponges shared a set of abundant OTUs that were 
      distinct from those associated with sponges from shallow waters. Comparison of
      the pyrosequencing data with that from shallow water sponges revealed that the
      microbial communities of all sponges analysed have similar archaeal populations
      but that the bacterial populations of the deep sea sponges were distinct. Further
      analysis of the common and abundant OTUs from the three LMA-like sponges placed
      them within the groups of ammonia oxidising Archaea (Thaumarchaeota) and sulphur 
      oxidising gamma-Proteobacteria (Chromatiales). Reads from these two groups made
      up over 70% of all 16S rRNA genes detected from the three LMA-like sponge
      samples, providing evidence of a putative common microbial assemblage associated 
      with deep sea LMA sponges.

TI  - Specificity and temporal dynamics of complex bacteria--sponge symbiotic
      interactions.
PG  - 2781-91
AB  - Microbes are known to form intricate and intimate relationships with most animal 
      and plant taxa. Microbe--host symbiotic associations are poorly explored in
      comparison with other species interaction networks. The current paradigm on
      symbiosis research stems from species-poor systems where pairwise and
      reciprocally specialized interactions between a single microbe and a single host 
      that coevolve are the norm. These symbioses involving just a few species are
      fascinating in their own right, but more diverse and complex host-associated
      microbial communities are increasingly found, with new emerging questions that
      require new paradigms and approaches. Here we adopt an intermediate complexity
      approach to study the specificity, phylogenetic community structure, and temporal
      variability of the subset of the most abundant bacteria associated with different
      sponge host species with diverse eco-evolutionary characteristics. We do so by
      using a monthly resolved annual temporal series of host-associated and
      free-living bacteria. Bacteria are very abundant and diverse within marine
      sponges, and these symbiotic interactions are hypothesized to have a very ancient
      origin. We show that host-bacteria reciprocal specialization depends on the
      temporal scale and level of taxonomic aggregation considered. Sponge hosts with
      similar eco-evolutionary characteristics (e.g., volume of tissue corresponding to
      microbes, water filtering rates, and microbial transmission type) have similar
      bacterial phylogenetic community structure when looking at interactions
      aggregated over time. In general, sponge hosts hypothesized to form more
      intricate relationships with bacteria show a remarkably persistent bacterial
      community over time. Other hosts, however, show a large turnover similar to that 
      observed for free-living bacterioplankton. Our study highlights the importance of
      exploring temporal variability in host--microbe interaction networks if we aim to
      determine how specific and persistent these poorly explored but extremely common 
      interactions are.

TI  - Comparisons of the fungal and protistan communities among different marine sponge
      holobionts by pyrosequencing.
PG  - 951-61
LID - 10.1007/s00248-014-0393-6 [doi]
AB  - To date, the knowledge of eukaryotic communities associated with sponges remains 
      limited compared with prokaryotic communities. In a manner similar to
      prokaryotes, it could be hypothesized that sponge holobionts have
      phylogenetically diverse eukaryotic symbionts, and the eukaryotic community
      structures in different sponge holobionts were probably different. In order to
      test this hypothesis, the communities of eukaryota associated with 11 species of 
      South China Sea sponges were compared with the V4 region of 18S ribosomal
      ribonucleic acid gene using 454 pyrosequencing. Consequently, 135 and 721 unique 
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of fungi and protists were obtained at 97 %
      sequence similarity, respectively. These sequences were assigned to 2 phyla of
      fungi (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) and 9 phyla of protists including 5 algal
      phyla (Chlorophyta, Haptophyta, Streptophyta, Rhodophyta, and Stramenopiles) and 
      4 protozoal phyla (Alveolata, Cercozoa, Haplosporidia, and Radiolaria) including 
      47 orders (12 fungi, 35 protists). Entorrhizales of fungi and 18 orders of
      protists were detected in marine sponges for the first time. Particularly,
      Tilletiales of fungi and Chlorocystidales of protists were detected for the first
      time in marine habitats. Though Ascomycota, Alveolata, and Radiolaria were
      detected in all the 11 sponge species, sponge holobionts have different fungi and
      protistan communities according to OTU comparison and principal component
      analysis at the order level. This study provided the first insights into the
      fungal and protistan communities associated with different marine sponge
      holobionts using pyrosequencing, thus further extending the knowledge on
      sponge-associated eukaryotic diversity.

TI  - The freshwater sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis harbours diverse Pseudomonas species 
      (Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales) with broad-spectrum antimicrobial
      activity.
PG  - e88429
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0088429 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria are believed to play an important role in the fitness and biochemistry
      of sponges (Porifera). Pseudomonas species (Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales)
      are capable of colonizing a broad range of eukaryotic hosts, but knowledge of
      their diversity and function in freshwater invertebrates is rudimentary. We
      assessed the diversity, structure and antimicrobial activities of Pseudomonas
      spp. in the freshwater sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis. Polymerase Chain
      Reaction--Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprints of the 
      global regulator gene gacA revealed distinct structures between sponge-associated
      and free-living Pseudomonas communities, unveiling previously unsuspected
      diversity of these assemblages in freshwater. Community structures varied across 
      E. fluviatilis specimens, yet specific gacA phylotypes could be detected by
      PCR-DGGE in almost all sponge individuals sampled over two consecutive years. By 
      means of whole-genome fingerprinting, 39 distinct genotypes were found within 90 
      fluorescent Pseudomonas isolates retrieved from E. fluviatilis. High frequency of
      in vitro antibacterial (49%), antiprotozoan (35%) and anti-oomycetal (32%)
      activities was found among these isolates, contrasting less-pronounced
      basidiomycetal (17%) and ascomycetal (8%) antagonism. Culture extracts of highly 
      predation-resistant isolates rapidly caused complete immobility or lysis of cells
      of the protozoan Colpoda steinii. Isolates tentatively identified as P. jessenii,
      P. protegens and P. oryzihabitans showed conspicuous inhibitory traits and
      correspondence with dominant sponge-associated phylotypes registered by
      cultivation-independent analysis. Our findings suggest that E. fluviatilis hosts 
      both transient and persistent Pseudomonas symbionts displaying antimicrobial
      activities of potential ecological and biotechnological value.

AB  - Microbial biofilms play important roles in initiating settlement of marine
      invertebrate larvae. Given the importance of habitat selection by the motile
      larval phase, understanding settlement choices is critical if we are to
      successfully predict the population dynamics of sessile adults. Marine microbial 
      biofilms show remarkable variability in community composition, often mediated by 
      environmental conditions and biofilm age. To determine if biofilm communities
      were influenced by the time allowed to establish (age) and/or seawater
      temperature, we manipulated experimental surfaces to firstly determine biofilm
      community composition and secondly test larval settlement responses for the
      abundant coral reef sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile. Microbial profiling of
      biofilms revealed different communities according to both age and temperature.
      Biofilm community composition, as a result of both elevated seawater temperature 
      and biofilm age, contributed to settlement for sponge larvae with markedly higher
      numbers of larvae settling to biofilms developed over longer periods (10 d) and
      at temperatures 2-6 degrees C above ambient.

AB  - Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems in the world.
      Most research has, however, focused on eukaryotes such as corals and fishes.
      Recently, there has been increasing interest in the composition of prokaryotes,
      particularly those inhabiting corals and sponges, but these have mainly focused
      on bacteria. There have been very few studies of coral reef Archaea, despite the 
      fact that Archaea have been shown to play crucial roles in nutrient dynamics,
      including nitrification and methanogenesis, of oligotrophic environments such as 
      coral reefs. Here, we present the first study to assess Archaea in four different
      coral reef biotopes (seawater, sediment, and two sponge species, Stylissa massa
      and Xestospongia testudinaria). The archaeal community of both sponge species and
      sediment was dominated by Crenarchaeota, while the seawater community was
      dominated by Euryarchaeota. The biotope explained more than 72% of the variation 
      in archaeal composition. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was
      highest in sediment and seawater biotopes and substantially lower in both sponge 
      hosts. No "sponge-specific" archaeal OTUs were found, i.e., OTUs found in both
      sponge species but absent from nonhost biotopes. Despite both sponge species
      hosting phylogenetically distinct microbial assemblages, there were only minor
      differences in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional
      pathways. In contrast, most functional pathways differed significantly between
      microbiomes from sponges and nonhost biotopes including all energy metabolic
      pathways. With the exception of the methane and nitrogen metabolic pathway, all
      energy metabolic pathways were enriched in sponges when compared to nonhost
      biotopes.

AB  - The whole metabolism of a sponge holobiont and the respective contributions of
      prokaryotic and eukaryotic symbionts and their associations with the sponge host 
      remain largely unclear. Meanwhile, compared with shallow water sponges, deep-sea 
      sponges are rarely understood. Here we report the metagenomic exploration of
      deep-sea sponge Neamphius huxleyi [corrected] . at the whole community level.
      Metagenomic data showed phylogenetically diverse prokaryotes and eukaryotes in
      Neamphius huxleyi [corrected]. MEGAN and gene enrichment analyses indicated
      different metabolic potentials of prokaryotic symbionts from eukaryotic
      symbionts, especially in nitrogen and carbon metabolisms, and their molecular
      interactions with the sponge host. These results supported the hypothesis that
      prokaryotic and eukaryotic symbionts have different ecological roles and
      relationships with sponge host. Moreover, vigorous denitrification, and CO2
      fixation by chemoautotrophic prokaryotes were suggested for this deep-sea sponge.
      The study provided novel insights into the respective potentials of prokaryotic
      and eukaryotic symbionts and their associations with deep-sea sponge Neamphius
      huxleyi [corrected].

TI  - Host-specificity among abundant and rare taxa in the sponge microbiome.
PG  - 1198-209
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2013.227 [doi]
AB  - Microbial communities have a key role in the physiology of the sponge host, and
      it is therefore essential to understand the stability and specificity of
      sponge-symbiont associations. Host-specific bacterial associations spanning large
      geographic distance are widely acknowledged in sponges. However, the full
      spectrum of specificity remains unclear. In particular, it is not known whether
      closely related sponges host similar or very different microbiota over wide
      bathymetric and geographic gradients, and whether specific associations extend to
      the rare members of the sponge microbiome. Using the ultra-deep Illumina
      sequencing technology, we conducted a comparison of sponge bacterial communities 
      in seven closely related Hexadella species with a well-resolved host phylogeny,
      as well as of a distantly related sponge Mycale. These samples spanned
      unprecedentedly large bathymetric (15-960 m) gradients and varying European
      locations. In addition, this study included a bacterial community analysis of the
      local background seawater for both Mycale and the widespread deep-sea taxa
      Hexadella cf. dedritifera. We observed a striking diversity of microbes
      associated with the sponges, spanning 47 bacterial phyla. The data did not reveal
      any Hexadella microbiota co-speciation pattern, but confirmed sponge-specific and
      species-specific host-bacteria associations, even within extremely low abundant
      taxa. Oligotyping analysis also revealed differential enrichment preferences of
      closely related Nitrospira members in closely related sponges species. Overall,
      these results demonstrate highly diverse, remarkably specific and stable
      sponge-bacteria associations that extend to members of the rare biosphere at a
      very fine phylogenetic scale, over significant geographic and bathymetric
      gradients.

AB  - Combining culture-dependent and independent approaches, we investigated for the
      first time the cultivable fraction of the prokaryotic community associated with
      the carnivorous sponge Asbestopluma hypogea. The heterotrophic prokaryotes
      isolated from this tiny sponge were compared between specimens freshly collected 
      from cave and maintained in aquarium. Overall, 67 isolates obtained in pure
      culture were phylogenetically affiliated to the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria,
      Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. This cultivable diversity was
      lower than the prokaryotic diversity obtained by previous pyrosequencing study
      and comparable to that of another Mediterranean demosponge, the filter-feeding
      Phorbas tenacior. Furthermore, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we
      visualized bacterial and archaeal cells, confirming the presence of both
      prokaryotes in A. hypogea tissue. Approximately 16% of the bacterial isolates
      tested positive for chitinolytic activity, suggesting potential microbial
      involvement in the digestion processes of crustacean prey by this carnivorous
      sponge. Additionally, 6% and 16% of bacterial isolates revealed antimicrobial and
      antioxidant activities, respectively. One Streptomyces sp. S1CA strain was
      identified as a promising candidate for the production of antimicrobial and
      antioxidant secondary metabolites as well as chitinolytic enzymes. Implications
      in the context of the sponge biology and prey-feeding strategy are discussed.

AB  - Microbes associated with marine sponges play significant roles in host
      physiology. Remarkable levels of microbial diversity have been observed in
      sponges worldwide through both culture-dependent and culture-independent studies.
      Most studies have focused on the structure of the bacterial communities in
      sponges and have involved sponges sampled from shallow waters. Here, we used
      pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to compare the bacterial and archaeal
      communities associated with two individuals of the marine sponge Inflatella
      pellicula from the deep-sea, sampled from a depth of 2,900 m, a depth which far
      exceeds any previous sequence-based report of sponge-associated microbial
      communities. Sponge-microbial communities were also compared to the microbial
      community in the surrounding seawater. Sponge-associated microbial communities
      were dominated by archaeal sequencing reads with a single archaeal OTU,
      comprising ~60% and ~72% of sequences, being observed from Inflatella pellicula. 
      Archaeal sequencing reads were less abundant in seawater (~11% of sequences).
      Sponge-associated microbial communities were less diverse and less even than any 
      other sponge-microbial community investigated to date with just 210 and 273 OTUs 
      (97% sequence identity) identified in sponges, with 4 and 6 dominant OTUs
      comprising ~88% and ~89% of sequences, respectively. Members of the candidate
      phyla, SAR406, NC10 and ZB3 are reported here from sponges for the first time,
      increasing the number of bacterial phyla or candidate divisions associated with
      sponges to 43. A minor cohort from both sponge samples (~0.2% and ~0.3% of
      sequences) were not classified to phylum level. A single OTU, common to both
      sponge individuals, dominates these unclassified reads and shares sequence
      homology with a sponge associated clone which itself has no known close relative 
      and may represent a novel taxon.

TI  - Evidence of unique and generalist microbes in distantly related sympatric
      intertidal marine sponges (Porifera: Demospongiae).

AB  - The diversity and specificity of microbial communities in marine environments is 
      a key aspect of the ecology and evolution of both the eukaryotic hosts and their 
      associated prokaryotes. Marine sponges harbor phylogenetically diverse and
      complex microbial lineages. Here, we investigated the sponge bacterial community 
      and distribution patterns of microbes in three sympatric intertidal marine
      demosponges, Hymeniacidon perlevis, Ophlitaspongia papilla and Polymastia
      penicillus, from the Atlantic coast of Portugal using classical isolation
      techniques and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. Microbial composition assessment,
      with nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (ca. 1400 bp) from the isolates
      (n = 31) and partial sequences (ca. 280 bp) from clone libraries (n = 349),
      revealed diverse bacterial communities and other sponge-associated microbes. The 
      majority of the bacterial isolates were members of the order Vibrionales and
      other symbiotic bacteria like Pseudovibrio ascidiaceiocola, Roseobacter sp.,
      Hahellaceae sp. and Cobetia sp. Extended analyses using ecological metrics
      comprising 142 OTUs supported the clear differentiation of bacterial community
      profiles among the sponge hosts and their ambient seawater. Phylogenetic analyses
      were insightful in defining clades representing shared bacterial communities,
      particularly between H. perlevis and the geographically distantly-related H.
      heliophila, but also among other sponges. Furthermore, we also observed three
      distinct and unique bacterial groups, Betaproteobactria (~81%), Spirochaetes
      (~7%) and Chloroflexi (~3%), which are strictly maintained in
      low-microbial-abundance host species O. papilla and P. penicillus. Our study
      revealed the largely generalist nature of microbial associations among these
      co-occurring intertidal marine sponges.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of heterotrophic bacterial communities from the marine

AB  - Heterotrophic bacteria associated with two specimens of the marine sponge Erylus 
      discophorus were screened for their capacity to produce bioactive compounds
      against a panel of human pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus wild type and
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus), 
      fish pathogen (Aliivibrio fischeri) and environmentally relevant bacteria (Vibrio
      harveyi). The sponges were collected in Berlengas Islands, Portugal. Of the 212
      isolated heterotrophic bacteria belonging to Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria,
      Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, 31% produced antimicrobial metabolites.
      Bioactivity was found against both Gram positive and Gram negative and clinically
      and environmentally relevant target microorganisms. Bioactivity was found mainly 
      against B. subtilis and some bioactivity against S. aureus MRSA, V. harveyi and
      A. fisheri. No antifungal activity was detected. The three most bioactive genera 
      were Pseudovibrio (47.0%), Vibrio (22.7%) and Bacillus (7.6%). Other less
      bioactive genera were Labrenzia, Acinetobacter, Microbulbifer, Pseudomonas,
      Gordonia, Microbacterium, Micrococcus and Mycobacterium, Paenibacillus and
      Staphylococcus. The search of polyketide I synthases (PKS-I) and nonribosomal
      peptide synthetases (NRPSs) genes in 59 of the bioactive bacteria suggested the
      presence of PKS-I in 12 strains, NRPS in 3 strains and both genes in 3 strains.
      Our results show the potential of the bacterial community associated with Erylus 
      discophorus sponges as producers of bioactive compounds.

TI  - Microbial community composition of a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor

      treatment of municipal sewage.

AB  - The microbial community composition of a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor
      in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)-DHS system used for the treatment
      of municipal sewage was investigated. The clone libraries showed marked
      differences in microbial community composition at different reactor heights and
      in different seasons. The dominant phylotypes residing in the upper part of the
      reactor were likely responsible for removing organic matters because a
      significant reduction in organic matter in the upper part was observed.
      Quantification of the amoA genes revealed that the proportions of ammonia
      oxidizing bacteria (AOB) varied along the vertical length of the reactor, with
      more AOB colonizing the middle and lower parts of the reactor than the top of the
      reactor. The findings indicated that sewage treatment was achieved by a
      separation of microbial habitats responsible for organic matter removal and
      nitrification in the DHS reactor.

AB  - In this study, we pursue unravelling the bacterial communities of 26 sponges,
      belonging to several taxonomical orders, and comprising low microbial abundance
      (LMA) and high microbial abundance (HMA) representatives. Particularly, we
      searched for species-specific bacteria, which could be considered as symbionts.
      To reduce temporal and spatial environmentally caused differences between host
      species, we sampled all the sponge species present in an isolated small rocky
      area in a single dive. The bacterial communities identified by pyrosequencing the
      16S rRNA gene showed that all HMA species clustered separated from LMA sponges
      and seawater. HMA sponges often had highest diversity, but some LMA sponges had
      also very diverse bacterial communities. Network analyses indicated that no core 
      bacterial community seemed to exist for the studied sponges, not even for such a 
      space and time-restricted sampling. Most sequences, particularly the most
      abundant ones in each species, were species-specific for both HMA and LMA
      sponges. The bacterial sequences retrieved from LMA sponges, despite being
      phylogenetically more similar to seawater, did not represent transient seawater
      bacteria. We conclude that sponge bacterial communities depend more on the host
      affiliation to the HMA or LMA groups than on host phylogeny.

      crambescidine-containing sponge Crambe crambe.
PG  - 2583
LID - 10.1038/srep02583 [doi]
AB  - Crambe crambe is a marine sponge that produces high concentrations of the
      pharmacologically significant pentacyclic guanidine alkaloids (PGAs),
      Crambescines and Crambescidines. Although bio-mimetic chemical synthesis of PGAs 
      suggests involvement of microorganisms in their biosynthesis, there are
      conflicting reports on whether bacteria are associated with this sponge or not.
      Using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing we show that the associated bacterial
      community of C. crambe is dominated by a single bacterial species affiliated to
      the Betaproteobacteria. Microscopy analysis of sponge tissue sections using a
      specific probe and in situ hybridization confirmed its dominance in the sponge
      mesohyl and a single microbial morphology was observed by transmission electron
      microscopy. If confirmed the presence of a simple bacteria community in C. crambe
      makes this association a very pertinent model to study sponge-bacteria
      interactions and should allow further research into the possible implication of
      bacteria in PGA biosynthesis.

AB  - Using 454 pyrosequencing, we characterized for the first time the associated
      microbial community of the deep-sea carnivorous Demosponge Asbestopluma hypogea
      (Cladorhizidae). Targeting the 16S rRNA gene V3 and V6 hypervariable regions, we 
      compared the diversity and composition of associated microbes of two individual
      sponges of A. hypogea freshly collected in the cave with surrounding seawater and
      with one sponge sample maintained 1 year in an aquarium after collection. With
      more than 22 961 high quality sequences from sponge samples, representing c. 800 
      operational taxonomic units per sponge sample at 97% sequence similarities, the
      phylogenetic affiliation of A. hypogea-associated microbes was assigned to 20
      bacterial and two archaeal phyla, distributed into 45 classes and 95 orders.
      Several differences between the sponge and seawater microbes were observed,
      highlighting a specific and stable A. hypogea microbial community dominated by
      Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and Thaumarchaeota phyla. A high relative
      abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and a dominance of sulfate
      oxidizing/reducing bacteria were observed. Our findings shed lights on the
      potential roles of associated microbial community in the lifestyle of A. hypogea.

AB  - Dispersal limitation and environmental selection are the main processes shaping
      free-living microbial communities, but host-related factors may also play a major
      role in structuring symbiotic communities. Here, we aimed to determine the
      effects of isolation-by-distance and host species on the spatial structure of
      sponge-associated bacterial communities using as a model the abundant demosponge 
      genus Ircinia. We targeted three co-occurring Ircinia species and used terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of 16S rRNA gene
      sequences to explore the differentiation of their bacterial communities across a 
      scale of hundreds of kilometres in the Western Mediterranean Sea. Multivariate
      analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots of T-RFLP profiles showed
      that bacterial communities in Ircinia sponges were structured by host species and
      remained stable across sampling locations, despite geographic distances (80-800
      km) and diverse local conditions. While significant differences among some
      locations were observed in Ircinia variabilis-derived communities, no correlation
      between geographic distance and community similarity was consistently detected
      for symbiotic bacteria in any host sponge species. Our results indicate that
      bacterial communities are mostly shaped by host species-specific factors and
      suggest that evolutionary processes acting on long-term symbiotic relationships
      have favored spatial stability of sponge-associated bacterial communities.

AB  - Marine lakes are unique ecosystems that contain isolated populations of marine
      organisms. Isolated from the surrounding marine habitat, many lakes house
      numerous endemic species. In this study, microbial communities of sponges
      inhabiting these lakes were investigated for the first time using barcoded
      pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Our main goals were to compare the
      bacterial richness and composition of two sponge species (Suberites diversicolor 
      and Cinachyrella australiensis) inhabiting both marine lakes and adjacent open
      coastal systems. Host species and habitat explained almost 59% of the variation
      in bacterial composition. There was a significant difference in composition
      between both host species. Within S. diversicolor, there was little discernible
      difference between bacterial communities inside and outside lakes. The bacterial 
      community of this species was, furthermore, dominated (63% of all sequences) by
      three very closely related alphaproteobacterial taxa identified as belonging to
      the recently described order Kiloniellales. Cinachyrella australiensis, in
      contrast, hosted markedly different bacterial communities inside and outside
      lakes with very few shared abundant taxa. Cinachyrella australiensis in open
      habitat only shared 9.4% of OTUs with C. australiensis in lake habitat. Bacteria 
      were thus both highly species specific and, in the case of C. australiensis,
      habitat specific.

AB  - Research on sponge microbial assemblages has revealed different trends in the
      geographic variability and specificity of bacterial symbionts. Here, we combined 
      replicated terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone
      library analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences to investigate the biogeographic and 
      host-specific structure of bacterial communities in two congeneric and sympatric 
      sponges: Ircinia strobilina, two color morphs of Ircinia felix and ambient
      seawater. Samples were collected from five islands of the Bahamas separated by 80
      to 400 km. T-RFLP profiles revealed significant differences in bacterial
      community structure among sponge hosts and ambient bacterioplankton. Pairwise
      statistical comparisons of clone libraries confirmed the specificity of the
      bacterial assemblages to each host species and differentiated symbiont
      communities between color morphs of I. felix. Overall, differences in bacterial
      communities within each host species and morph were unrelated to location. Our
      results show a high degree of symbiont fidelity to host sponge across a spatial
      scale of up to 400 km, suggesting that host-specific rather than biogeographic
      factors play a primary role in structuring and maintaining sponge-bacteria
      relationships in Ircinia species from the Bahamas.

TI  - Phylogenetic diversity and community structure of the symbionts associated with
      the coralline sponge Astrosclera willeyana of the Great Barrier Reef.
PG  - 740-52
LID - 10.1007/s00248-013-0212-5 [doi]
AB  - The coralline sponge Astrosclera willeyana, considered to be a living
      representative of the reef-building stromatoporoids of the Mesozoic and the
      Paleozoic periods, occurs widely throughout the Indo-Pacific oceans. We aimed to 
      examine, for the first time, the phylogenetic diversity of the microbial
      symbionts associated with A. willeyana using molecular methods and to investigate
      the spatial variability in the sponge-derived microbial communities of A.
      willeyana from diverse sites along the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both denaturing 
      gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses of 12 Astrosclera specimens and
      sequencing of a 16S rRNA gene clone library, constructed using a specimen of A.
      willeyana from the Yonge Reef (380 clones), revealed the presence of a complex
      microbial community with high diversity. An assessment of the 16S rRNA gene
      sequences to the particular phylogenetic groups showed domination of the
      Chloroflexi (42 %), followed by the Gammaproteobacteria (14 %), Actinobacteria
      (11 %), Acidobacteria (8 %), and the Deferribacteres (7 %). Of the microbes that 
      were identified, a further 15 % belonged to the Deltaproteobacteria,
      Alphaproteobacteria, and Nitrospirae genera. The minor phylogenetic groups
      Gemmatimonadetes, Spirochaetes, Cyanobacteria, Poribacteria, and the Archaea
      composed 3 % of the community. Over 94 % of the sequences obtained from A.
      willeyana grouped together with other sponge- or coral-derived sequences, and of 
      these, 72 % formed, with nearest relatives, 46 sponge-specific or sponge-coral
      clusters, highlighting the uniqueness of the microbial consortia in sponges. The 
      DGGE results showed clear divisions according to the geographical origin of the
      samples, indicating closer relationships between the microbial communities with
      respect to their geographic origin (northern vs. southern GBR).

AB  - The characterization of changes in microbial communities is an essential step
      towards a better understanding of host-microbe associations. It is well
      established that sponges (phylum Porifera) harbour a diverse and abundant
      microbial community, but it is not known whether these microbial communities
      change over time. Here, we followed two sponge species (Ancorina alata and Tethya
      stolonifera) over a 2-year sampling period using RNA (16S rRNA)-based amplicon
      pyrosequencing and bulk stable isotope analysis (delta(13) C and delta(15)N). A
      total of 4468 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was identified, which
      were affiliated with 26 bacterial phyla. Bacterial communities of both sponge
      species were remarkably stable throughout the monitoring period, driven by a
      small number of OTUs that dominated their respective communities. Variability of 
      sponge-associated bacterial communities was driven by OTUs that were low in
      abundance or transient over time. Stable isotope analysis provided evidence of
      both bacteria- and host-derived nutrients and their variability throughout the
      season. While delta(15) N values were similar, significant differences were found
      in delta(13) C of sponge tissue, indicative of a varying reliance on particulate 
      organic matter as a carbon source. Further temporal studies, such as those
      undertaken here, will be highly valuable to identify which members of a sponge
      bacterial community are truly symbiotic in nature.

AB  - Do bacterial taxa demonstrate clear endemism, like macroorganisms, or can one
      site's bacterial community recapture the total phylogenetic diversity of the
      world's oceans? Here we compare a deep bacterial community characterization from 
      one site in the English Channel (L4-DeepSeq) with 356 datasets from the
      International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM) taken from around the globe
      (ranging from marine pelagic and sediment samples to sponge-associated
      environments). At the L4-DeepSeq site, increasing sequencing depth uncovers
      greater phylogenetic overlap with the global ICoMM data. This site contained
      31.7-66.2% of operational taxonomic units identified in a given ICoMM biome.
      Extrapolation of this overlap suggests that 1.93 x 10(11) sequences from the L4
      site would capture all ICoMM bacterial phylogenetic diversity. Current technology
      trends suggest this limit may be attainable within 3 y. These results strongly
      suggest the marine biosphere maintains a previously undetected, persistent
      microbial seed bank.

TI  - Characterizing the bacterial associates of three Caribbean sponges along a
      gradient from shallow to mesophotic depths.
PG  - 74-84
LID - 10.1111/1574-6941.12099 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriosponges have been shown to support relatively stable microbial
      communities across both distance and time, but little is known about the effect
      of depth on the composition of the associated community. To address this
      question, we examined the bacterial communities associated with three common
      Caribbean bacteriosponges collected at the same location over a depth gradient
      from approximately 10-100 m. The 16S rRNA genes of the associated communities
      were assessed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and clone
      library analyses. Our results indicated that the stability and specificity of the
      associated bacterial communities varied with the host sponge but that each sponge
      supported a distinct community. Analyses of similarity suggested differences in
      community composition with depth, but examination of in silico predicted terminal
      restriction fragments failed to identify bacteria that occurred specifically at
      particular depths. Plakortis angulospiculatus, Agelas conifera, and Xestospongia 
      muta supported diverse Chloroflexi species, while X. muta appeared to be the only
      sponge that hosted a cyanobacterial community. Regardless of host sponge, each
      species maintained a 'core' group of bacterial associates across a depth range
      with the composition of the remaining community presumably influenced by both
      biotic and abiotic factors.

TI  - Quality or quantity: is nutrient transfer driven more by symbiont identity and
      productivity than by symbiont abundance?
PG  - 1116-25
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2013.7 [doi]
AB  - By forming symbiotic interactions with microbes, many animals and plants gain
      access to the products of novel metabolic pathways. We investigated the transfer 
      of symbiont-derived carbon and nitrogen to the sponges Aplysina cauliformis,
      Aplysina fulva, Chondrilla caribensis, Neopetrosia subtriangularis and
      Xestospongia bocatorensis, all of which host abundant microbial populations, and 
      Niphates erecta, which hosts a sparse symbiont community. We incubated sponges in
      light and dark bottles containing seawater spiked with (13)C- and (15)N-enriched 
      inorganic compounds and then measured (13)C and (15)N enrichment in the microbial
      (nutrient assimilation) and sponge (nutrient transfer) fractions. Surprisingly,
      although most sponges hosting abundant microbial communities were more enriched
      in (13)C than N. erecta, only N. subtriangularis was more enriched in (15)N than 
      N. erecta. Although photosymbiont abundance varied substantially across species, 
      (13)C and (15)N enrichment was not significantly correlated with photosymbiont
      abundance. Enrichment was significantly correlated with the ratio of gross
      productivity to respiration (P:R), which varied across host species and symbiont 
      phylotype. Because irradiance impacts P:R ratios, we also incubated A.
      cauliformis in (13)C-enriched seawater under different irradiances to determine
      whether symbiont carbon fixation and transfer are dependent on irradiance. Carbon
      fixation and transfer to the sponge host occurred in all treatments, but was
      greatest at higher irradiances and was significantly correlated with P:R ratios. 
      Taken together, these results demonstrate that nutrient transfer from microbial
      symbionts to host sponges is influenced more by host-symbiont identities and P:R 
      ratios than by symbiont abundance.

TI  - Relationships between host phylogeny, host type and bacterial community diversity
      in cold-water coral reef sponges.
PG  - e55505
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0055505 [doi]
AB  - Cold-water coral reefs are known to locally enhance the diversity of deep-sea
      fauna as well as of microbes. Sponges are among the most diverse faunal groups in
      these ecosystems, and many of them host large abundances of microbes in their
      tissues. In this study, twelve sponge species from three cold-water coral reefs
      off Norway were investigated for the relationship between sponge phylogenetic
      classification (species and family level), as well as sponge type (high versus
      low microbial abundance), and the diversity of sponge-associated bacterial
      communities, taking also geographic location and water depth into account.
      Community analysis by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA)
      showed that as many as 345 (79%) of the 437 different bacterial operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in the dataset were shared between sponges and
      sediments, while only 70 (16%) appeared purely sponge-associated. Furthermore,
      changes in bacterial community structure were significantly related to sponge
      species (63% of explained community variation), sponge family (52%) or sponge
      type (30%), whereas mesoscale geographic distances and water depth showed
      comparatively small effects (<5% each). In addition, a highly significant,
      positive relationship between bacterial community dissimilarity and sponge
      phylogenetic distance was observed within the ancient family of the Geodiidae.
      Overall, the high diversity of sponges in cold-water coral reefs, combined with
      the observed sponge-related variation in bacterial community structure, support
      the idea that sponges represent heterogeneous, yet structured microbial habitats 
      that contribute significantly to enhancing bacterial diversity in deep-sea
      ecosystems.

TI  - Microbial diversity in the coralline sponge Vaceletia crypta.
PG  - 1041-56
LID - 10.1007/s10482-013-9884-6 [doi]
AB  - Coralline sponges of the genus Vaceletia are regarded as 'living fossils', the
      only recent members of the so-called 'sphinctozoan-type' sponges that contributed
      to reef-building during the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic eras. Vaceletia species were 
      thought to be extinct until the discovery of Vaceletia crypta in the 1970s. Here,
      we used molecular methods to provide first insights into the microbial diversity 
      of these coralline sponges. Both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
      analyses of 19 Vaceletia specimens and the analysis of 427 clones from a
      bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone library of a specimen of V. crypta from the Great
      Barrier Reef (Australia) revealed high diversity and a complex composition with a
      relatively uniform phylogenetic distribution. Only a single archaeal 16S rRNA
      phylotype was recovered. The most abundant bacteria were the Chloroflexi (35 %). 
      Of the microbial community, 58 % consisted of the Gammaproteobacteria,
      Gemmatimonadetes, Actinobacteria, Nitrospira, Deltaproteobacteria,
      Deferribacteres and Acidobacteria, with nearly equal representation. Less
      abundant members of the microbial community belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria
      (3 %), as well as to the Poribacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria,
      Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus and Archaea (all together 4 %). 
      Of the established 96 OTUs, 88 % were closely related to other sponge-derived
      sequences and thereof 71 OTUs fell into sponge- or sponge-coral specific
      clusters, which underscores that the "living fossil" coralline sponge Vaceletia
      shares features of its microbial community with other sponges. The DGGE cluster
      analysis indicated distinct microbial communities in the different growth forms
      (solitary and colonial) of Vaceletia species.

AB  - Screening of metagenomic DNA of microbial community, associated with Baikalian
      sponge Lubomirskia baicalensis, was made to show the presence of polyketide
      synthase genes (PKS). PKS enzymatic systems take part in synthesis of a great
      number of biologically-active substances. Cloning and sequencing of amplified
      products of the ketosynthase domain section of PKS gene cluster has revealed 15
      fragments of PKS genes differing from each other's on 35-65% by aminoacid
      sequences. BLASTX analysis has shown that all these sequences belong to the
      KS-domains identified in various groups of microorganisms: alpha-, beta-,
      delta-Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta. Some sequences
      were related to the genes which are taking part in biosynthesis of curacin A
      (CurI, CurJ), stigmatellin (StiC, StiG), nostophycin (NpnB), and cryptophycins
      (CrpB). The homology of the found sequences with those of the EMBL database
      varies within 50-82% confirming the presence in fresh-water sponge community the 
      genes for synthesis of the new, yet not studied polyketide substances, possessing
      the biotechnological potential.

AB  - Recent studies have unravelled the diversity of sponge-associated bacteria that
      may play essential roles in sponge health and metabolism. Nevertheless, our
      understanding of this microbiota remains limited to a few host species found in
      restricted geographical localities, and the extent to which the sponge host
      determines the composition of its own microbiome remains a matter of debate. We
      address bacterial abundance and diversity of two temperate marine sponges
      belonging to the Irciniidae family--Sarcotragus spinosulus and Ircinia
      variabilis--in the Northeast Atlantic. Epifluorescence microscopy revealed that
      S. spinosulus hosted significantly more prokaryotic cells than I. variabilis and 
      that prokaryotic abundance in both species was about 4 orders of magnitude higher
      than in seawater. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) profiles of S. spinosulus and I. variabilis differed
      markedly from each other--with higher number of ribotypes observed in S.
      spinosulus--and from those of seawater. Four PCR-DGGE bands, two specific to S.
      spinosulus, one specific to I. variabilis, and one present in both sponge
      species, affiliated with an uncultured sponge-specific phylogenetic cluster in
      the order Acidimicrobiales (Actinobacteria). Two PCR-DGGE bands present
      exclusively in S. spinosulus fingerprints affiliated with one sponge-specific
      phylogenetic cluster in the phylum Chloroflexi and with sponge-derived sequences 
      in the order Chromatiales (Gammaproteobacteria), respectively. One
      Alphaproteobacteria band specific to S. spinosulus was placed in an uncultured
      sponge-specific phylogenetic cluster with a close relationship to the genus
      Rhodovulum. Our results confirm the hypothesized host-specific composition of
      bacterial communities between phylogenetically and spatially close sponge species
      in the Irciniidae family, with S. spinosulus displaying higher bacterial
      community diversity and distinctiveness than I. variabilis. These findings
      suggest a pivotal host-driven effect on the shape of the marine sponge
      microbiome, bearing implications to our current understanding of the distribution
      of microbial genetic resources in the marine realm.

AB  - Coral reefs are under considerable pressure from global stressors such as
      elevated sea surface temperature and ocean acidification, as well as local
      factors including eutrophication and poor water quality. Marine sponges are
      diverse, abundant and ecologically important components of coral reefs in both
      coastal and offshore environments. Due to their exceptionally high filtration
      rates, sponges also form a crucial coupling point between benthic and pelagic
      habitats. Sponges harbor extensive microbial communities, with many microbial
      phylotypes found exclusively in sponges and thought to contribute to the health
      and survival of their hosts. Manipulative experiments were undertaken to
      ascertain the impact of elevated nutrients and seawater temperature on health and
      microbial community dynamics in the Great Barrier Reef sponge Rhopaloeides
      odorabile. R. odorabile exposed to elevated nutrient levels including 10
      micromol/L total nitrogen at 31 degrees C appeared visually similar to those
      maintained under ambient seawater conditions after 7 days. The symbiotic
      microbial community, analyzed by 16S rRNA gene pyrotag sequencing, was highly
      conserved for the duration of the experiment at both phylum and operational
      taxonomic unit (OTU) (97% sequence similarity) levels with 19 bacterial phyla and
      1743 OTUs identified across all samples. Additionally, elevated nutrients and
      temperatures did not alter the archaeal associations in R. odorabile, with
      sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealing similar Thaumarchaeota diversity 
      and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealing consistent amoA gene
      patterns, across all experimental treatments. A conserved eukaryotic community
      was also identified across all nutrient and temperature treatments by DGGE. The
      highly stable microbial associations indicate that R. odorabile symbionts are
      capable of withstanding short-term exposure to elevated nutrient concentrations
      and sub-lethal temperatures.

AB  - Large-scale mortality of marine invertebrates is a major global concern for ocean
      ecosystems and many sessile, reef-building animals, such as sponges and corals,
      are experiencing significant declines through temperature-induced disease and
      bleaching. The health and survival of marine invertebrates is often dependent on 
      intimate symbiotic associations with complex microbial communities, yet we have a
      very limited understanding of the detailed biology and ecology of both the host
      and the symbiont community in response to environmental stressors, such as
      elevated seawater temperatures. Here, we use the ecologically important sponge
      Rhopaloeides odorabile as a model to explore the changes in symbiosis during the 
      development of temperature-induced necrosis. Expression profiling of the sponge
      host was examined in conjunction with the phylogenetic and functional structure
      and the expression profile of the symbiont community. Elevated temperature causes
      an immediate stress response in both the host and symbiont community, including
      reduced expression of functions that mediate their partnership. Disruption to
      nutritional interdependence and molecular interactions during early heat stress
      further destabilizes the holobiont, ultimately leading to the loss of archetypal 
      sponge symbionts and the introduction of new microorganisms that have functional 
      and expression profiles consistent with a scavenging lifestyle, a lack virulence 
      functions and a high growth rate. Previous models have postulated various
      mechanisms of mortality and disease in marine invertebrates. Our study suggests
      that interruption of symbiotic interactions is a major determinant for mortality 
      in marine sessile invertebrates. High symbiont specialization and low functional 
      redundancy, thus make these holobionts extremely vulnerable to environmental
      perturbations, including climate change.

AB  - Marine sponges are diverse, abundant and provide a crucial coupling point between
      benthic and pelagic habitats due to their high filtration rates. They also
      harbour extensive microbial communities, with many microbial phylotypes found
      exclusively in sponge hosts and not in the seawater or surrounding environment,
      i.e. so-called sponge-specific clusters (SCs) or sponge- and coral-specific
      clusters (SCCs). We employed DNA (16S rRNA gene) and RNA (16S rRNA)-based
      amplicon pyrosequencing to investigate the effects of sublethal thermal stress on
      the bacterial biosphere of the Great Barrier Reef sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile. 
      A total of 8381 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (97% sequence similarity) were
      identified, affiliated with 32 bacterial phyla from seawater samples, 23
      bacterial phyla from sponge DNA extracts and 18 bacterial phyla from sponge RNA
      extracts. Sublethal thermal stress (31 degrees C) had no effect on the present
      and/or active portions of the R. odorabile bacterial community but a shift in the
      bacterial assemblage was observed in necrotic sponges. Over two-thirds of DNA and
      RNA sequences could be assigned to previously defined SCs/SCCs in healthy sponges
      whereas only 12% of reads from necrotic sponges could be assigned to SCs/SCCs. A 
      rapid decline in host health over a 1 degrees C temperature increment suggests
      that sponges such as R. odorabile may be highly vulnerable to the effects of
      global climate change.

TI  - Deep sequencing of Myxilla (Ectyomyxilla) methanophila, an epibiotic sponge on
      cold-seep tubeworms, reveals methylotrophic, thiotrophic, and putative

AB  - The encrusting sponge Myxilla (Ectyomyxilla) methanophila (Poecilosclerida:
      Myxillidae) is an epibiont on vestimentiferan tubeworms at hydrocarbon seeps on
      the upper Louisiana slope of the Gulf of Mexico. It has long been suggested that 
      this sponge harbors methylotrophic bacteria due to its low delta(13)C value and
      high methanol dehydrogenase activity, yet the full community of microbial
      associations in M. methanophila remained uncharacterized. In this study, we
      sequenced 16S rRNA genes representing the microbial community in M. methanophila 
      collected from two hydrocarbon-seep sites (GC234 and Bush Hill) using both Sanger
      sequencing and next-generation 454 pyrosequencing technologies. Additionally, we 
      compared the microbial community in M. methanophila to that of the biofilm
      collected from the associated tubeworm. Our results revealed that the microbial
      diversity in the sponges from both sites was low but the community structure was 
      largely similar, showing a high proportion of methylotrophic bacteria of the
      genus Methylohalomonas and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading
      bacteria of the genera Cycloclasticus and Neptunomonas. Furthermore, the sponge
      microbial clone library revealed the dominance of thioautotrophic
      gammaproteobacterial symbionts in M. methanophila. In contrast, the biofilm
      communities on the tubeworms were more diverse and dominated by the
      chemoorganotrophic Moritella at GC234 and methylotrophic Methylomonas and
      Methylohalomonas at Bush Hill. Overall, our study provides evidence to support
      previous suggestion that M. methanophila harbors methylotrophic symbionts and
      also reveals the association of PAH-degrading and thioautotrophic microbes in the
      sponge.

AB  - To understand the functioning of sponges, knowledge of the structure of their
      associated microbial communities is necessary. However, our perception of
      sponge-associated microbiomes remains mainly restricted to marine ecosystems.
      Here, we report on the molecular diversity and composition of bacteria in the
      freshwater sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis inhabiting the artificial lake
      Vinkeveense Plassen, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Polymerase chain
      reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprints revealed
      that the apparent diversities within the domain Bacteria and the phylum
      Actinobacteria were lower in E. fluviatilis than in bulk water. Enrichment of
      specific PCR-DGGE bands in E. fluviatilis was detected. Furthermore, sponge- and 
      bulk water-derived bacterial clone libraries differed with respect to bacterial
      community composition at the phylum level. E. fluviatilis-derived sequences were 
      affiliated with six recognized phyla, i.e., Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes,
      Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae and Verrucomicrobia, in order of
      relative abundance; next to the uncultured candidate phylum TM7 and one deeply
      rooted bacterial lineage of undefined taxonomy (BLUT). Actinobacteria,
      Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla in the
      freshwater clone library whereas sequences affiliated with Planctomycetes,
      Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria and Armatimonadetes were found at lower
      frequencies. Fine-tuned phylogenetic inference showed no or negligible overlaps
      between the E. fluviatilis and water-derived phylotypes within bacterial taxa
      such as Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. We also
      ascertained the status of two alphaproteobacterial lineages as freshwater
      sponge-specific phylogenetic clusters, and report on high distinctiveness of
      other E. fluviatilis specific phylotypes, especially within the Bacteroidetes,
      Planctomycetes and Chlamydia taxa. This study supports the contention that the
      composition and diversity of bacteria in E. fluviatilis is partially driven by
      the host organism.

TI  - Stability of sponge-associated bacteria over large seasonal shifts in temperature
      and irradiance.
PG  - 7358-68
AB  - Complex microbiomes reside in marine sponges and consist of diverse microbial
      taxa, including functional guilds that may contribute to host metabolism and
      coastal marine nutrient cycles. Our understanding of these symbiotic systems is
      based primarily on static accounts of sponge microbiota, while their temporal
      dynamics across seasonal cycles remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated
      temporal variation in bacterial symbionts of three sympatric sponges (Ircinia
      spp.) over 1.5 years in the northwestern (NW) Mediterranean Sea, using replicated
      terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library
      analyses of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. Bacterial symbionts in Ircinia
      spp. exhibited host species-specific structure and remarkable stability
      throughout the monitoring period, despite large fluctuations in temperature and
      irradiance. In contrast, seawater bacteria exhibited clear seasonal shifts in
      community structure, indicating that different ecological constraints act on
      free-living and on symbiotic marine bacteria. Symbiont profiles were dominated by
      persistent, sponge-specific bacterial taxa, notably affiliated with phylogenetic 
      lineages capable of photosynthesis, nitrite oxidation, and sulfate reduction.
      Variability in the sponge microbiota was restricted to rare symbionts and
      occurred most prominently in warmer seasons, coincident with elevated thermal
      regimes. Seasonal stability of the sponge microbiota supports the hypothesis of
      host-specific, stable associations between bacteria and sponges. Further, the
      core symbiont profiles revealed in this study provide an empirical baseline for
      diagnosing abnormal shifts in symbiont communities. Considering that these
      sponges have suffered recent, episodic mass mortalities related to thermal
      stresses, this study contributes to the development of model sponge-microbe
      symbioses for assessing the link between symbiont fluctuations and host health.

AB  - It has long been recognized that sponges differ in the abundance of associated
      microorganisms, and they are therefore termed either 'low microbial abundance'
      (LMA) or 'high microbial abundance' (HMA) sponges. Many previous studies
      concentrated on the dense microbial communities in HMA sponges, whereas little is
      known about microorganisms in LMA sponges. Here, two LMA sponges from the Red
      Sea, two from the Caribbean and one from the South Pacific were investigated.
      With up to only five bacterial phyla per sponge, all LMA sponges showed lower
      phylum-level diversity than typical HMA sponges. Interestingly, each LMA sponge
      was dominated by a large clade within either Cyanobacteria or different classes
      of Proteobacteria. The overall similarity of bacterial communities among LMA
      sponges determined by operational taxonomic unit and UniFrac analysis was low.
      Also the number of sponge-specific clusters, which indicate bacteria specifically
      associated with sponges and which are numerous in HMA sponges, was low. A
      biogeographical or host-dependent distribution pattern was not observed. In
      conclusion, bacterial community profiles of LMA sponges are clearly different
      from profiles of HMA sponges and, remarkably, each LMA sponge seems to harbour
      its own unique bacterial community.

TI  - Spatial distribution of prokaryotic symbionts and ammoxidation, denitrifier
      bacteria in marine sponge Astrosclera willeyana.
PG  - 528
LID - 10.1038/srep00528 [doi]
AB  - The present knowledge of microbial community mainly focus on total sponge, the
      spatial distribution of microbes in sponges is rarely known, especially those
      with potential ecological functions. In this study, based on gene library and
      integral-LIBSHUFF analysis, the spatial distribution of prokaryotic symbionts and
      nitrogen cycling genes in the cortex and endosome sections of sponge Astrosclera 
      willeyana were investigated. A significance difference of bacterial phylotypes
      between the cortex and endosome was revealed. For example Bacteroidetes,
      Frankineae and Propionibacterineae were detected only in the endosome, whereas
      Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetacia and Micrococcineae were only associated with the 
      cortex. Some branches of alpha-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria,
      Corynebacterineae, Acidimicobidae, Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota also showed
      distribution difference. Bacterial denitrifiers and ammonia oxidizing bacteria
      (AOB) were observed using nirS and amoA genes as markers. Particularly, AOB were 
      only associated with the endosome. This study highlighted the spatial
      distribution of bacterial symbionts especially those with ammonia oxidization
      function.

TI  - Taxonomic and functional microbial signatures of the endemic marine sponge
      Arenosclera brasiliensis.
PG  - e39905
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0039905 [doi]
AB  - The endemic marine sponge Arenosclera brasiliensis (Porifera, Demospongiae,
      Haplosclerida) is a known source of secondary metabolites such as arenosclerins
      A-C. In the present study, we established the composition of the A. brasiliensis 
      microbiome and the metabolic pathways associated with this community. We used 454
      shotgun pyrosequencing to generate approximately 640,000 high-quality
      sponge-derived sequences ( approximately 150 Mb). Clustering analysis including
      sponge, seawater and twenty-three other metagenomes derived from marine animal
      microbiomes shows that A. brasiliensis contains a specific microbiome. Fourteen
      bacterial phyla (including Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria,
      Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Cloroflexi) were consistently found in the A.
      brasiliensis metagenomes. The A. brasiliensis microbiome is enriched for
      Betaproteobacteria (e.g., Burkholderia) and Gammaproteobacteria (e.g.,
      Pseudomonas and Alteromonas) compared with the surrounding planktonic microbial
      communities. Functional analysis based on Rapid Annotation using Subsystem
      Technology (RAST) indicated that the A. brasiliensis microbiome is enriched for
      sequences associated with membrane transport and one-carbon metabolism. In
      addition, there was an overrepresentation of sequences associated with aerobic
      and anaerobic metabolism as well as the synthesis and degradation of secondary
      metabolites. This study represents the first analysis of sponge-associated
      microbial communities via shotgun pyrosequencing, a strategy commonly applied in 
      similar analyses in other marine invertebrate hosts, such as corals and algae. We
      demonstrate that A. brasiliensis has a unique microbiome that is distinct from
      that of the surrounding planktonic microbes and from other marine organisms,
      indicating a species-specific microbiome.

TI  - Thermal and sedimentation stress are unlikely causes of brown spot syndrome in
      the coral reef sponge, Ianthella basta.
PG  - e39779
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0039779 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Marine diseases are being increasingly linked to anthropogenic
      factors including global and local stressors. On the Great Barrier Reef, up to
      66% of the Ianthella basta population was recently found to be afflicted by a
      syndrome characterized by brown spot lesions and necrotic tissue.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Manipulative experiments were undertaken to
      ascertain the role of environmental stressors in this syndrome. Specifically, the
      effects of elevated temperature and sedimentation on sponge health and symbiont
      stability in I. basta were examined. Neither elevated temperature nor increased
      sedimentation were responsible for the brown spot lesions, but sponges exposed to
      32 degrees C developed substantial discoloration and deterioration of their
      tissues, resulting in death after eight days and a higher microbial diversity in 
      those samples. No shifts in the microbial community of I. basta were observed
      across a latitudinal gradient or with increased sedimentation, with three
      previously described symbionts dominating the community of all sponges
      (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Thaumarchaea).
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results from this study highlight the stable microbial 
      community of I. basta and indicate that thermal and sedimentation stress are not 
      responsible for the brown spot lesions currently affecting this abundant and
      ecologically important sponge species.

TI  - Pyrosequencing of bacterial symbionts within Axinella corrugata sponges:
      diversity and seasonal variability.
PG  - e38204
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0038204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Marine sponge species are of significant interest to many scientific 
      fields including marine ecology, conservation biology, genetics, host-microbe
      symbiosis and pharmacology. One of the most intriguing aspects of the sponge
      "holobiont" system is the unique physiology, interaction with microbes from the
      marine environment and the development of a complex commensal microbial
      community. However, intraspecific variability and temporal stability of
      sponge-associated bacterial symbionts remain relatively unknown.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have characterized the bacterial symbiont
      community biodiversity of seven different individuals of the Caribbean reef
      sponge Axinella corrugata, from two different Florida reef locations during
      variable seasons using multiplex 454 pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA amplicons. Over 
      265,512 high-quality 16 S rRNA sequences were generated and analyzed. Utilizing
      versatile bioinformatics methods and analytical software such as the QIIME and
      CloVR packages, we have identified 9,444 distinct bacterial operational taxonomic
      units (OTUs). Approximately 65,550 rRNA sequences (24%) could not be matched to
      bacteria at the class level, and may therefore represent novel taxa.
      Differentially abundant classes between seasonal Axinella communities included
      Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria,
      Acidobacter and Nitrospira. Comparisons with a proximal outgroup sponge species
      (Amphimedon compressa), and the growing sponge symbiont literature, indicate that
      this study has identified approximately 330 A. corrugata-specific symbiotic OTUs,
      many of which are related to the sulfur-oxidizing Ectothiorhodospiraceae. This
      family appeared exclusively within A. corrugata, comprising >34.5% of all
      sequenced amplicons. Other A. corrugata symbionts such as Deltaproteobacteria,
      Bdellovibrio, and Thiocystis among many others are described.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Slight shifts in several bacterial taxa were observed
      between communities sampled during spring and fall seasons. New 16 S rDNA
      sequences and concomitant identifications greatly expand the microbial community 
      profile for this model reef sponge, and will likely be useful as a baseline for
      any future comparisons regarding sponge microbial community dynamics.

AB  - Sponges can host abundant and diverse communities of symbiotic microorganisms. In
      this chapter, we review recent work in the area of sponge-microbe symbioses,
      focusing on (1) the diversity of these associations, (2) host specificity, (3)
      modes of symbiont transmission, and (4) the positive and negative impacts of
      symbionts on their hosts. Over the past 4 years, numerous studies have catalogued
      the diversity of sponge-microbe symbioses, challenging previous hypotheses of a
      uniform, vertically transmitted microbial community and supporting a mixed model 
      of symbiont community transmission. We emphasize the need for experimental
      manipulations of sponge-symbiont interactions coupled with advanced laboratory
      techniques to determine the identity of metabolically active microbial symbionts,
      to investigate the physiological processes underlying these interactions, and to 
      elucidate whether symbionts act as mutualists, commensals, or parasites. The
      amazing diversity of these complex associations continues to offer critical
      insights into the evolution of symbiosis and the impacts of symbiotic microbes on
      nutrient cycling and other ecosystem functions.

AB  - Over the past four decades, sponge research has advanced by leaps and bounds
      through endeavours such as the Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems (CCRE) programme
      at the U.S. National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Since its
      founding in the early 1970s, the programme has been dedicated to a detailed
      multidisciplinary study of a section of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the
      Atlantic's largest reef complex, and has generated data far beyond the capability
      of lone investigators and brief expeditions. This reef complex extends 250 km
      southward from Yucatan, Mexico, into the Gulf of Honduras, most of it lying 20-40
      km off the coast of Belize. A relatively unspoiled ecosystem, it features a great
      variety of habitats in close proximity, ranging from mangrove islands, seagrass
      meadows, and patch reefs in its lagoon to the barrier reef along the margin of
      the continental shelf. Among its varied macrobenthos, sponges stand out for their
      ubiquity, range of colours, rich species and biomass, and ecological importance; 
      they populate rocky substrates, some sandy bottoms, and the subtidal stilt roots 
      and peat banks of mangroves. Working from a field station established in 1972 on 
      Carrie Bow Cay, a sand islet atop the reef off southern Belize, experts in
      numerous disciplines from both the Museum and academic institutions throughout
      the world have explored the area's biodiversity in the broadest sense and
      community development over time. At last count, 113 researchers (88 working on
      site) have focused on the biological and geological role of Porifera in Carrie
      Bow's reef communities, with the results reported in 125 scientific papers to
      date. The majority of these sponge studies have centred on systematics and
      faunistics, including quantitative distribution among the various habitats.
      Taxonomic approaches have ranged from basic morphology to fine structure, DNA
      barcoding, and ecological manipulations and culminated in a mini-workshop
      involving several experts on Caribbean Porifera. Ecological work has covered a
      broad spectrum as well: bioerosion, silica and nutrient cycling, symbiosis,
      mutualism, space competition, predation, disease, and the effects on sponge
      individuals and populations of environmental factors such as light, temperature, 
      salinity, desiccation, substrate, and sedimentation. Many projects were enhanced 
      by scientific illustration, laboratory studies of larvae settlement preferences
      and development, and investigations of microbial and invertebrate sponge
      associates, notably symbiotic cyanobacteria, parazoanthid epizoans, and
      crustacean and ophiuroid endobionts. Of the striking discoveries, the work on
      alpheid shrimps colonizing sponges off Carrie Bow Cay has yielded the first
      report of eusociality in marine organisms.

AB  - The marine lithistid sponge Discodermia spp. (Family Theonellidae) contains many 
      types of associated bacteria visible in the mesohyl while biofilms cover the
      pinacoderm. This study determined the identity of bacteria associated with
      members of the genus Discodermia using microbial culture, 16S rRNA gene clone
      libraries and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Four samples of Discodermia
      spp. were collected at depths between 24-161 m near Grand Bahama Island and Cay
      Sal Bank, Bahamas. A total of 80 unique isolates and 94 different clone sequences
      from at least eight bacterial classes were obtained. It appeared that Discodermia
      spp. may have a core community of bacteria that is common to all sponges of this 
      genus. Species of at least six different classes of bacteria were regularly found
      in most of the sponge specimens collected, irrespective of collection depth or
      location. This indicates that a diverse spectrum of bacteria is associated with
      lithistid sponges irrespective of the transient seawater community that enters
      the sponge.

PG  - 407-18
LID - 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01365.x [doi]
AB  - Marine sponges can harbor dense and diverse bacterial communities, yet we have a 
      limited understanding of important aspects of this symbiosis. We developed an
      experimental methodology that permits manipulating the composition of the
      microbial community. Specifically, we evaluated sponge cell aggregates (SCA) from
      Clathria prolifera that had been treated with different classes of antibiotics to
      determine whether this system might offer novel experimental approaches to the
      study of sponge/bacterial symbioses. Microscopic analysis of the SCA demonstrated
      that two distinct morphological types of microbiota existed on the external
      surface vs. the internal regions of the SCA. Denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries indicated 
      that we were unable to create entirely aposymbiotic SCA but that different
      classes of antibiotics produced distinctive shifts in the SCA-associated
      bacterial community. After exposure to antibiotics, some bacterial species were
      'revealed', thus uncovering novel components of the sponge-associated community. 
      The antibiotic treatments used here had little discernible effect on the
      formation of SCA or subsequent development of the adult. The experimental
      approach we describe offers empirical options for studying the role symbionts
      play in sponge growth and development and for ascertaining relationships among
      bacterial species in communities residing in sponges.

AB  - Geodia barretti is a marine cold-water sponge harbouring high numbers of
      microorganisms. Significant rates of nitrification have been observed in this
      sponge, indicating a substantial contribution to nitrogen turnover in marine
      environments with high sponge cover. In order to get closer insights into the
      phylogeny and function of the active microbial community and the interaction with
      its host G. barretti, a metatranscriptomic approach was employed, using the
      simultaneous analysis of rRNA and mRNA. Of the 262 298 RNA-tags obtained by
      pyrosequencing, 92% were assigned to ribosomal RNA (ribo-tags). A total of 109
      325 SSU rRNA ribo-tags revealed a detailed picture of the community, dominated by
      group SAR202 of Chloroflexi, candidate phylum Poribacteria and Acidobacteria,
      which was different in its composition from that obtained in clone libraries
      prepared form the same samples. Optimized assembly strategies allowed the
      reconstruction of full-length rRNA sequences from the short ribo-tags for more
      detailed phylogenetic studies of the dominant taxa. Cells of several phyla were
      visualized by FISH analyses for confirmation. Of the remaining 21 325 RNA-tags,
      10 023 were assigned to mRNA-tags, based on similarities to genes in the
      databases. A wide range of putative functional gene transcripts from over 10
      different phyla were identified among the bacterial mRNA-tags. The most abundant 
      mRNAs were those encoding key metabolic enzymes of nitrification from
      ammonia-oxidizing archaea as well as candidate genes involved in related
      processes. Our analysis demonstrates the potential and limits of using a combined
      rRNA and mRNA approach to explore the microbial community profile, phylogenetic
      assignments and metabolic activities of a complex, but little explored microbial 
      community.

AB  - Most marine sponges establish a persistent association with a wide array of
      phylogenetically and physiologically diverse microbes. To date, the role of these
      symbiotic microbial communities in the metabolism and nutrient cycles of the
      sponge-microbe consortium remains largely unknown. We identified and quantified
      the microbial communities associated with three common Mediterranean sponge
      species, Dysidea avara, Agelas oroides and Chondrosia reniformis (Demospongiae)
      that cohabitate coralligenous community. For each sponge we quantified the uptake
      and release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), inorganic
      nitrogen and phosphate. Low microbial abundance and no evidence for DOC uptake or
      nitrification were found for D. avara. In contrast A. oroides and C. reniformis
      showed high microbial abundance (30% and 70% of their tissue occupied by microbes
      respectively) and both species exhibited high nitrification and high DOC and
      NH(4) (+) uptake. Surprisingly, these unique metabolic pathways were mediated in 
      each sponge species by a different, and host specific, microbial community. The
      functional convergence of microbial consortia found in these two sympatric sponge
      species, suggest that these metabolic processes may be of special relevance to
      the success of the holobiont.

TI  - Bacterial and archaeal symbionts in the South China Sea sponge Phakellia fusca:
      community structure, relative abundance, and ammonia-oxidizing populations.
PG  - 701-13

AB  - Many biologically active natural products have been isolated from Phakellia
      fusca, an indigenous sponge in the South China Sea; however, the microbial
      symbionts of Phakellia fusca remain unknown. The present investigations on sponge
      microbial community are mainly based on qualitative analysis, while quantitative 
      analysis, e.g., relative abundance, is rarely carried out, and little is known
      about the roles of microbial symbionts. In this study, the community structure
      and relative abundance of bacteria, actinobacteria, and archaea associated with
      Phakellia fusca were revealed by 16S rRNA gene library-based sequencing and
      quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The ammonia-oxidizing populations were
      investigated based on amoA gene and anammox-specific 16S rRNA gene libraries. As 
      a result, it was found that bacterial symbionts of sponge Phakellia fusca consist
      of Proteobacteria including Gamma-, Alpha-, and Delta-proteobacteria,
      Cyanobacteria with Gamma-proteobacteria as the predominant components. In
      particular, the diversity of actinobacterial symbionts in Phakellia fusca is
      high, which is composed of Corynebacterineae, Acidimicrobidae, Frankineae,
      Micrococcineae, and Streptosporangineae. All the observed archaea in sponge
      Phakellia fusca belong to Crenarchaeota, and the detected ammonia-oxidizing
      populations are ammonia-oxidizing archaea, suggesting the nitrification function 
      of sponge archaeal symbionts. According to qRT-PCR analysis, bacterial symbionts 
      dominated the microbial community, while archaea represented the second
      predominant symbionts, followed by actinobacteria. The revealed diverse
      prokaryotic symbionts of Phakellia fusca are valuable for the understanding and
      in-depth utilization of Phakellia fusca microbial symbionts. This study extends
      our knowledge of the community, especially the relative abundance of microbial
      symbionts in sponges.

AB  - Sponges harbour complex communities of diverse microorganisms, which have been
      postulated to form intimate symbiotic relationships with their host. Here we
      unravel some of these interactions by characterising the functional features of
      the microbial community of the sponge Cymbastela concentrica through a combined
      metagenomic and metaproteomic approach. We discover the expression of specific
      transport functions for typical sponge metabolites (for example, halogenated
      aromatics, dipeptides), which indicates metabolic interactions between the
      community and the host. We also uncover the simultaneous performance of aerobic
      nitrification and anaerobic denitrification, which would aid to remove ammonium
      secreted by the sponge. Our analysis also highlights the requirement for the
      microbial community to respond to variable environmental conditions and hence
      express an array of stress protection proteins. Molecular interactions between
      symbionts and their host might also be mediated by a set of expressed
      eukaryotic-like proteins and cell-cell mediators. Finally, some sponge-associated
      bacteria (for example, a Phyllobacteriaceae phylotype) appear to undergo an
      evolutionary adaptation process to the sponge environment as evidenced by active 
      mobile genetic elements. Our data clearly show that a combined metaproteogenomic 
      approach can provide novel information on the activities, physiology and
      interactions of sponge-associated microbial communities.

TI  - Pyrosequencing reveals diverse and distinct sponge-specific microbial communities
      in sponges from a single geographical location in Irish waters.

AB  - Marine sponges are host to numerically vast and phylogenetically diverse
      bacterial communities, with 26 major phyla to date having been found in close
      association with sponge species worldwide. Analyses of these microbial
      communities have revealed many sponge-specific novel genera and species. These
      endosymbiotic microbes are believed to play significant roles in sponge
      physiology including the production of an array of bioactive secondary
      metabolites. Here, we report on the use of culture-based and culture-independent 
      (pyrosequencing) techniques to elucidate the bacterial community profiles
      associated with the marine sponges Raspailia ramosa and Stelligera stuposa
      sampled from a single geographical location in Irish waters and with ambient
      seawater. To date, little is known about the microbial ecology of sponges of
      these genera. Culture isolation grossly underestimated sponge-associated
      bacterial diversity. Four bacterial phyla (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
      Firmicutes, Proteobacteria) were represented amongst ~200 isolates, compared with
      ten phyla found using pyrosequencing. Long average read lengths of ~430 bp (V1-V3
      region of 16S rRNA gene) allowed for robust resolution of sequences to genus
      level. Bacterial OTUs (2,109 total), at 95% sequence similarity, from ten
      bacterial phyla were recovered from R. ramosa, 349 OTUs were identified in S.
      stuposa representing eight phyla, while 533 OTUs from six phyla were found in
      surrounding seawater. Bacterial communities differed significantly between sponge
      species and the seawater. Analysis of the data for sponge-specific taxa revealed 
      that 2.8% of classified reads from the sponge R. ramosa can be defined as
      sponge-specific, while 26% of S. stuposa sequences represent sponge-specific
      bacteria. Novel sponge-specific clusters were identified, whereas the majority of
      previously reported sponge-specific clusters (e.g. Poribacteria) were absent from
      these sponge species. This deep and robust analysis provides further evidence
      that the microbial communities associated with marine sponge species are highly
      diverse and divergent from one another and appear to be host-selected through as 
      yet unknown processes.

TI  - A specific mix of generalists: bacterial symbionts in Mediterranean Ircinia spp.
PG  - 619-37
LID - 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01243.x [doi]
AB  - Microbial symbionts form abundant and diverse components of marine sponge
      holobionts, yet the ecological and evolutionary factors that dictate their
      community structure are unresolved. Here, we characterized the bacterial symbiont
      communities of three sympatric host species in the genus Ircinia from the NW
      Mediterranean Sea, using electron microscopy and replicated 16S rRNA gene
      sequence clone libraries. All Ircinia host species harbored abundant and
      phylogenetically diverse symbiont consortia, comprised primarily of sequences
      related to other sponge-derived microorganisms. Community-level analyses of
      bacterial symbionts revealed host species-specific genetic differentiation and
      structuring of Ircinia-associated microbiota. Phylogenetic analyses of host
      sponges showed a close evolutionary relationship between Ircinia fasciculata and 
      Ircinia variabilis, the two host species exhibiting more similar symbiont
      communities. In addition, several bacterial operational taxonomic units were
      shared between I. variabilis and Ircinia oros, the two host species inhabiting
      semi-sciophilous communities in more cryptic benthic habitats, and absent in I.
      fasciculata, which occurs in exposed, high-irradiance habitats. The generalist
      nature of individual symbionts and host-specific structure of entire communities 
      suggest that: (1) a 'specific mix of generalists' framework applies to bacterial 
      symbionts in Ircinia hosts and (2) factors specific to each host species
      contribute to the distinct symbiont mix observed in Ircinia hosts.

TI  - Phylogenetic diversity, host-specificity and community profiling of
      sponge-associated bacteria in the northern Gulf of Mexico.
PG  - e26806
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0026806 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Marine sponges can associate with abundant and diverse consortia of
      microbial symbionts. However, associated bacteria remain unexamined for the
      majority of host sponges and few studies use phylogenetic metrics to quantify
      symbiont community diversity. DNA fingerprinting techniques, such as terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP), might provide rapid profiling
      of these communities, but have not been explicitly compared to traditional
      methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the bacterial
      communities associated with the marine sponges Hymeniacidon heliophila and
      Haliclona tubifera, a sympatric tunicate, Didemnum sp., and ambient seawater from
      the northern Gulf of Mexico by combining replicated clone libraries with T-RFLP
      analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Clone libraries revealed that bacterial
      communities associated with the two sponges exhibited lower species richness and 
      lower species diversity than seawater and tunicate assemblages, with differences 
      in species composition among all four source groups. T-RFLP profiles clustered
      microbial communities by source; individual T-RFs were matched to the majority
      (80.6%) of clone library sequences, indicating that T-RFLP analysis can be used
      to rapidly profile these communities. Phylogenetic metrics of community diversity
      indicated that the two sponge-associated bacterial communities include dominant
      and host-specific bacterial lineages that are distinct from bacteria recovered
      from seawater, tunicates, and unrelated sponge hosts. In addition, a large
      proportion of the symbionts associated with H. heliophila were shared with
      distant, conspecific host populations in the southwestern Atlantic (Brazil).
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The low diversity and species-specific nature of
      bacterial communities associated with H. heliophila and H. tubifera represent a
      distinctly different pattern from other, reportedly universal, sponge-associated 
      bacterial communities. Our replicated sampling strategy, which included samples
      that reflect the ambient environment, allowed us to differentiate resident
      symbionts from potentially transient or prey bacteria. Pairing replicated clone
      library construction with rapid community profiling via T-RFLP analyses will
      greatly facilitate future studies of sponge-microbe symbioses.

TI  - Assessing the complex sponge microbiota: core, variable and species-specific
      bacterial communities in marine sponges.
PG  - 564-76
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2011.116 [doi]
AB  - Marine sponges are well known for their associations with highly diverse, yet
      very specific and often highly similar microbiota. The aim of this study was to
      identify potential bacterial sub-populations in relation to sponge phylogeny and 
      sampling sites and to define the core bacterial community. 16S ribosomal RNA gene
      amplicon pyrosequencing was applied to 32 sponge species from eight locations
      around the world's oceans, thereby generating 2567 operational taxonomic units
      (OTUs at the 97% sequence similarity level) in total and up to 364 different OTUs
      per sponge species. The taxonomic richness detected in this study comprised 25
      bacterial phyla with Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Poribacteria being most
      diverse in sponges. Among these phyla were nine candidate phyla, six of them
      found for the first time in sponges. Similarity comparison of bacterial
      communities revealed no correlation with host phylogeny but a tropical
      sub-population in that tropical sponges have more similar bacterial communities
      to each other than to subtropical sponges. A minimal core bacterial community
      consisting of very few OTUs (97%, 95% and 90%) was found. These microbes have a
      global distribution and are probably acquired via environmental transmission. In 
      contrast, a large species-specific bacterial community was detected, which is
      represented by OTUs present in only a single sponge species. The species-specific
      bacterial community is probably mainly vertically transmitted. It is proposed
      that different sponges contain different bacterial species, however, these
      bacteria are still closely related to each other explaining the observed
      similarity of bacterial communities in sponges in this and previous studies. This
      global analysis represents the most comprehensive study of bacterial symbionts in
      sponges to date and provides novel insights into the complex structure of these
      unique associations.

AB  - Post-treatment of anaerobic wastewater was undertaken to biologically oxidize
      dissolved methane, with the aim of preventing methane emission. The performance
      of dissolved methane oxidation and competition for oxygen among methane,
      ammonium, organic matter, and sulfide oxidizing bacteria were investigated using 
      a lab-scale closed-type down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor. Under the oxygen 
      abundant condition of a hydraulic retention time of 2h and volumetric air supply 
      rate of 12.95m(3)-airm(-3)day(-1), greater than 90% oxidation of dissolved
      methane, ammonium, sulfide, and organic matter was achieved. With reduction in
      the air supply rate, ammonium oxidation first ceased, after which methane
      oxidation deteriorated. Sulfide oxidation was disrupted in the final step,
      indicating that COD and sulfide oxidation occurred prior to methane oxidation. A 
      microbial community analysis revealed that peculiar methanotrophic communities
      dominating the Methylocaldum species were formed in the DHS reactor operation.

      demonstrated. Here we report the cultivation of a methanogenic microbial
      consortium from subseafloor sediments using a continuous-flow-type bioreactor
      with polyurethane sponges as microbial habitats, called down-flow hanging sponge 
      (DHS) reactor. We anaerobically incubated methane-rich core sediments collected
      from off Shimokita Peninsula, Japan, for 826 days in the reactor at 10 degrees C.
      Synthetic seawater supplemented with glucose, yeast extract, acetate and
      propionate as potential energy sources was provided into the reactor. After 289
      days of operation, microbiological methane production became evident.
      Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed the presence of
      metabolically active microbial cells with various morphologies in the reactor.
      DNA- and RNA-based phylogenetic analyses targeting 16S rRNA indicated the
      successful growth of phylogenetically diverse microbial components during
      cultivation in the reactor. Most of the phylotypes in the reactor, once it made
      methane, were more closely related to culture sequences than to the subsurface
      environmental sequence. Potentially methanogenic phylotypes related to the genera
      Methanobacterium, Methanococcoides and Methanosarcina were predominantly detected
      concomitantly with methane production, while uncultured archaeal phylotypes were 
      also detected. Using the methanogenic community enrichment as subsequent inocula,
      traditional batch-type cultivations led to the successful isolation of several
      anaerobic microbes including those methanogens. Our results substantiate that the
      DHS bioreactor is a useful system for the enrichment of numerous fastidious
      microbes from subseafloor sediments and will enable the physiological and
      ecological characterization of pure cultures of previously uncultivated
      subseafloor microbial life.

AB  - Compared with sponge-associated bacteria, the phylogenetic diversity of fungi in 
      sponge and the association of sponge fungi remain largely unknown. Meanwhile, no 
      detection of polyketide synthase (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)
      genes in sponge-associated fungi has been attempted. In this study, diverse and
      novel cultivable fungi including 10 genera (Aspergillus, Ascomycete, Fusarium,
      Isaria, Penicillium, Plectosphaerella, Pseudonectria, Simplicillium, Trichoderma,
      and Volutella) in four orders (Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Microascales, and
      Phyllachorales) of phylum Ascomycota were isolated from 10 species marine sponges
      in the South China Sea. Eurotiales and Hypocreales fungi were suggested as sponge
      generalists. The predominant isolates were Penicillium and Aspergillus in
      Eurotiales followed by Volutella in Hypocreales. Based on the conserved
      Beta-ketosynthase of PKS and A domain of NRPS, 15 polyketide synthases, and four 
      non-ribosomal peptides synthesis genes, including non-reducing and reducing PKSs 
      and hybrid PKS-NRPS, were detected in these fungal isolates. A lateral gene
      transfer event was indicated in the comparison between the phylogenetic diversity
      of 18S rRNA genes and beta-ketoacyl synthase domain sequences. Some fungi,
      especially those with PKS or NRPS genes, showed antimicrobial activity against P.
      fluorescens, S. aureus and B. subtilis. It was the first time to investigate PKS 
      and NRPS genes in sponge-associated fungi. Based on the detected antibiotics
      biosynthesis-related PKS and NRPS genes and antimicrobial activity, the potential
      ecological role of sponge-associated fungi in the chemical defense for sponge
      host was suggested. This study extended our knowledge of sponge-associated fungal
      phylogenetic diversity and their potential roles in the chemical defense.

AB  - Terpios hoshinota, a dark encrusting sponge, is known to be a competitor for
      space in coral reef environments, and facilitates the death of corals. Although
      numerous cyanobacteria have been detected in the sponge, little is known of the
      sponge-associated bacterial community. This study examined the sponge-associated 
      bacterial community and the difference between the bacterial communities in the
      sponge and the coral partially covered by the sponge by analysis of 16S rRNA gene
      sequences of samples isolated from the sponge covering the corals Favia
      complanata, Isopora palifera, Millepora sp., Montipora efflorescens and Porites
      lutea. The sponge-associated bacterial community was mainly (61-98%) composed of 
      cyanobacteria, with approximately 15% of these alphaproteobacteria and
      gammaproteobacteria, although the proportions varied in different sponge samples.
      The dominant cyanobacteria group was an isolated group closely related to
      Prochloron sp. The comparison of the bacterial communities isolated from
      sponge-free and the sponge-covered P. lutea showed that covering by the sponge
      caused changes in the coral-associated bacterial communities, with the presence
      of bacteria similar to those detected in black-band disease, suggesting the
      sponge might benefit from the presence of bacteria associated with unhealthy
      coral, particularly in the parts of the coral closest to the margin of the
      sponge.

TI  - High-rate nitrogen removal from anaerobic digester liquor using an up-flow
      anammox reactor with polyethylene sponge as a biomass carrier.
PG  - 306-11
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.10.010 [doi]
AB  - Here, the stable performance of nitrogen removal from digester liquor after
      partial nitrification was experimentally demonstrated in an up-flow anammox
      reactor with polyethylene sponge (PE sponge) as a biomass carrier. A high
      nitrogen loading rate of 8.4 kg-N/m(3)/day with a TN removal rate of 7.6
      kg-N/m(3)/day was obtained in this study, indicating PE sponge carrier is
      effective to attain high nitrogen removal performance. This high NLR should be
      mainly attributed to the successfully operational strategy, the biomass carrier
      with strong adsorption as well as the functional microbial community. The
      reaction ratio of NH(4)(+):NO(2)(-):NO(3)(-) using the anaerobic digester liquor 
      as feeding media was 1:1.09:0.14. In addition, the channeling phenomenon was
      investigated in this study, and the problem could be solved through keeping the
      sludge bed lower than 2/3 of the effective height of the reactor. Furthermore,
      the settling property of the anammox granules was enhanced significantly and the 
      bacteria community was verified by DNA analysis. The new species of anammox
      bacteria (kumadai-1) and KSU-1 were confirmed to be the predominant species after
      stable anammox performance was obtained.

TI  - Diversity of Mycobacterium species from marine sponges and their sensitivity to
      antagonism by sponge-derived rifamycin-synthesizing actinobacterium in the genus 
      Salinispora.
PG  - 33-40
LID - 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2010.02118.x [doi]
AB  - Eleven isolates of Mycobacterium species as well as an antimycobacterial
      Salinispora arenicola strain were cultured from the sponge Amphimedon
      queenslandica. The 16S rRNA, rpoB, and hsp65 genes from these Mycobacterium
      isolates were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis of a concatenated alignment
      showed the formation of a large clade with Mycobacterium poriferae isolated
      previously from another sponge species. The separation of these Mycobacterium
      isolates into three species-level groups was evident from sequence similarity and
      phylogenetic analyses. In addition, an isolate that is phylogenetically related
      to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was recovered from the sponge Fascaplysinopsis sp. 
      Several different mycobacteria thus appear to co-occur in the same sponge. An
      actinobacterium closely related to S. arenicola, a known producer of the
      antimycobacterial rifamycins, was coisolated from the same A. queenslandica
      specimen from which mycobacteria had been isolated. This Salinispora isolate was 
      confirmed to synthesize rifamycin and displayed inhibitory effects against
      representatives from two of three Mycobacterium phylotype groups. Evidence for
      antagonism of sponge-derived Salinispora against sponge-derived Mycobacterium
      strains from the same sponge specimen and the production of antimycobacterial
      antibiotics by this Salinispora strain suggest that the synthesis of such
      antibiotics may have functions in competition between sponge microbial community 
      members.

TI  - Bacterial community dynamics in the marine sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile under in

AB  - Cultivation of sponges is being explored to supply biomaterial for the
      pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. This study assesses the impact of
      various cultivation methods on the microbial community within the sponge
      Rhopaloeides odorabile during: (1) in situ cultivation under natural
      environmental conditions, (2) ex situ cultivation in small flow-through aquaria
      and (3) ex situ cultivation in large mesocosm systems. Principal components
      analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles indicated a stable
      microbial community in sponges cultured in situ (grown in the wild) and in
      sponges cultured ex situ in small flow-through aquaria over 12 weeks. In
      contrast, a shift in the microbial community was detected in sponges cultivated
      ex situ in large mesocosm aquaria for 12 months. This shift included (1) a loss
      of some stable microbial inhabitants, including members of the Poribacteria,
      Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria and (2) the addition of new microbes not detected
      in the wild sponges. Many of these acquired bacteria had highest similarity to
      known sponge-associated microbes, indicating that the sponge may be capable of
      actively selecting its microbial community. Alternatively, long-term ex situ
      cultivation may cause a shift in the dominant microbes that facilitates the
      growth of the more rare species. The microbial community composition varied
      between sponges cultivated in mesocosm aquaria with different nutrient
      concentrations and seawater chemistry, suggesting that these variables play a
      role in structuring the sponge-associated microbes. The high growth and symbiont 
      stability in R. odorabile cultured in situ confirm that this is the preferred
      method of aquaculture for this species at this time.

AB  - Sponges form close relationships with bacteria, and a remarkable phylogenetic
      diversity of yet-uncultured bacteria has been identified from sponges using
      molecular methods. In this study, we use a comparative metagenomic analysis of
      the bacterial community in the model sponge Cymbastela concentrica and in the
      surrounding seawater to identify previously unrecognized genomic signatures and
      functions for sponge bacteria. We observed a surprisingly large number of
      transposable insertion elements, a feature also observed in other symbiotic
      bacteria, as well as a set of predicted mechanisms that may defend the sponge
      community against the introduction of foreign DNA and hence contribute to its
      genetic resilience. Moreover, several shared metabolic interactions between
      bacteria and host include vitamin production, nutrient transport and utilization,
      and redox sensing and response. Finally, an abundance of protein-protein
      interactions mediated through ankyrin and tetratricopeptide repeat proteins could
      represent a mechanism for the sponge to discriminate between food and resident
      bacteria. These data provide new insight into the evolution of symbiotic
      diversity, microbial metabolism and host-microbe interactions in sponges.

TI  - Open circuit versus closed circuit enrichment of anodic biofilms in MFC: effect
      on performance and anodic communities.
PG  - 1699-713
LID - 10.1007/s00253-010-2624-1 [doi]
AB  - The influence of various carbon anodes; graphite, sponge, paper, cloth, felt,
      fiber, foam and reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC); on microbial fuel cell (MFC)
      performance is reported. The feed was brewery wastewater diluted in domestic
      wastewater. Biofilms were grown at open circuit or under an external load.
      Microbial diversity was analysed as a function of current and anode material. The
      bacterial community formed at open circuit was influenced by the anode material. 
      However at closed circuit its role in determining the bacterial consortia formed 
      was less important than the passage of current. The rate and extent of organic
      matter removal were similar for all materials: over 95% under closed circuit. The
      biofilm in MFCs working at open circuit and in the control reactors, increased
      COD removal by up to a factor of nine compared with that for baseline reactors.
      The average voltage output was 0.6 V at closed circuit, with an external resistor
      of 300 kOmega and 0.75 V at open circuit for all materials except RVC. The poor
      performance of this material might be related to the surface area available and
      concentration polarizations caused by the morphology of the material and the
      structure of the biofilm. Peak power varied from 1.3 mW m(-2) for RVC to 568 mW
      m(-2) for graphite with biofilm grown at closed circuit.

AB  - Molecular fingerprinting of 16S rRNA genes using terminal restriction fragment
      length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
      was used to characterize the temporal and spatial variability among
      sponge-associated bacteria from Mycale hentscheli having distinct bioactive
      chemotypes. Cluster analysis of T-RFLP and DGGE profiles from M. hentscheli
      chemotypes largely grouped sponge microbial diversity to their distinct chemotype
      pattern. Repeat sampling of individual M. hentscheli at one location over a
      21-month period showed that the T-RFLP profiles from individual sponges had
      similarity indices ranging from 60% to 82% and calculated DGGE similarities
      between 23% and 95%. However, a portion (>35% from DGGE and >19% from T-RFLP) of 
      the microbial community from M. hentscheli appeared to be spatially conserved
      through all M. hentscheli populations. Sequence analysis of DGGE band fragments
      showed a similarity among the bands originating from different individuals,
      different times, and different locations. The sponge-associated relationship of
      these bands was confirmed, with sequences having similarity to sponge-associated 
      bacteria reported from global locations. This study highlights the spatial and
      temporal complexity in the distribution of bacterial communities associated with 
      different chemotypes of the marine sponge M. hentscheli.

PG  - 17-30
LID - 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00862.x [doi]
AB  - Mesophotic coral ecosystems that occur at depths from 30 to 200 m have
      historically been understudied and yet appear to support a diverse biological
      community. The microbiology of these systems is particularly poorly understood,
      especially with regard to the communities associated with corals, sponges, and
      algae. This lack of information is partly due to the problems associated with
      gaining access to these environments and poor reproducibility across sampling
      methods. To summarize what is known about the microbiology of these ecosystems
      and to highlight areas where research is urgently needed, an overview of the
      current state of knowledge is presented. Emphasis is placed on the
      characterization of microbial populations, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic,
      associated with corals, sponges, and algae and the factors that influence
      microbial community structure. In topic areas where virtually nothing is known
      from mesophotic environments, the knowledge pertaining to shallow-water
      ecosystems is summarized to provide a starting point for a discussion on what
      might be expected in the mesophotic zone.

TI  - Efficient treatment of garbage slurry in methanogenic bioreactor packed by
      fibrous sponge with high porosity.
PG  - 1573-83
LID - 10.1007/s00253-010-2469-7 [doi]
AB  - Adding a supporting material to a methanogenic bioreactor treating garbage slurry
      can improve efficiency of methane production. However, little is known on how
      characteristics (e.g., porosity and hydrophobicity) of the supporting material
      affect the bioreactor degrading garbage slurry. We describe the reactor
      performances and microbial communities in bioreactors containing hydrophilic or
      hydrophobic sheets, or fibrous hydrophilic or hydrophobic sponges. The porosity
      affected the efficiency of methane production and solid waste removal more than
      the hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of the supporting material. When the
      terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was used at a lower
      organic loading rate (OLR), microbial diversities in the suspended fraction were 
      retained on the hydrophobic, but not the hydrophilic, sheets. Moreover, real-time
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed at a higher OLR revealed
      that the excellent performance of reactors containing fibrous sponges with high
      porosity (98%) was supported by a clear increase in the numbers of methanogens on
      these sponges, resulting in larger total numbers of methanogens in the reactors. 
      In addition, the bacterial communities in fractions retained on both the
      hydrophobic and hydrophilic fibrous sponges differed from those in the suspended 
      fraction, thus increasing bacterial diversity in the reactor. Thus, higher
      porosity of the supporting material improves the bioreactor performance by
      increasing the amount of methanogens and bacterial diversity; surface
      hydrophobicity contributes to maintaining the suspended microbial community.

TI  - Activity profiles for marine sponge-associated bacteria obtained by 16S rRNA vs
      16S rRNA gene comparisons.
PG  - 498-508

AB  - The phylogenetic diversity of microorganisms in marine sponges is becoming
      increasingly well described, yet relatively little is known about the activities 
      of these symbionts. Given the seemingly favourable environment provided to
      microbes by their sponge hosts, as indicated by the extraordinarily high
      abundance of sponge symbionts, we hypothesized that the majority of
      sponge-associated bacteria are active in situ. To test this hypothesis we
      compared, for the first time in sponges, 16S rRNA gene- vs 16S rRNA-derived
      bacterial community profiles to gain insights into symbiont composition and
      activity, respectively. Clone libraries revealed a highly diverse bacterial
      community in Ancorina alata, and a much lower diversity in Polymastia sp., which 
      were identified by electron microscopy as a high- and a low-microbial abundance
      sponge, respectively. Substantial overlap between DNA and RNA libraries was
      evident at both phylum and phylotype levels, indicating in situ activity for a
      large fraction of sponge-associated bacteria. This active fraction included
      uncultivated, sponge-specific lineages within, for example, Actinobacteria,
      Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes. This study shows the potential of RNA vs DNA
      comparisons based on the 16S rRNA gene to provide insights into the activity of
      sponge-associated microorganisms.

AB  - Metagenomics provides access to the uncultured majority of the microbial world.
      The approaches employed in this field have, however, had limited success in
      linking functional genes to the taxonomic or phylogenetic origin of the organism 
      they belong to. Here we present an efficient strategy to recover environmental
      DNA fragments that contain phylogenetic marker genes from metagenomic libraries. 
      Our method involves the cleavage of 23S ribsosmal RNA (rRNA) genes within pooled 
      library clones by the homing endonuclease I-CeuI followed by the insertion and
      selection of an antibiotic resistance cassette. This approach was applied to
      screen a library of 6500 fosmid clones derived from the microbial community
      associated with the sponge Cymbastela concentrica. Several fosmid clones were
      recovered after the screen and detailed phylogenetic and taxonomic assignment
      based on the rRNA gene showed that they belong to previously unknown organisms.
      In addition, compositional features of these fosmid clones were used to classify 
      and taxonomically assign a dataset of environmental shotgun sequences. Our
      approach represents a valuable tool for the analysis of rapidly increasing,
      environmental DNA sequencing information.

TI  - Comparison of the bacterial communities of wild and captive sponge Clathria
      prolifera from the Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - The red-beard sponge Clathria prolifera, which is widely distributed in the USA, 
      has been widely used as a model system in cell biology and has been proposed as a
      suitable teaching tool on biology and environmental sciences. We undertook the
      first detailed microbiological study of this sponge on samples collected from the
      Chesapeake Bay. A combination of culture-based studies, denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis, and bacterial community characterization based on 16S rRNA gene 
      sequencing revealed that C. prolifera contains a diverse assemblage of bacteria
      that is different from that in the surrounding water. C. prolifera individuals
      were successfully maintained in a flow-through or recirculation aquaculture
      system for over 6 months and shifts in the bacterial assemblages of sponges in
      aquaculture compared with wild sponges were examined. The proteobacteria,
      bacteroidetes, actinobacteria, and cyanobacteria represented over 90% of the
      species diversity present in the total bacterial community of the wild C.
      prolifera. Actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, and spirochetes were not represented in
      clones obtained from C. prolifera maintained in the aquaculture system although
      these three groups comprised ca. 20% of the clones from wild C. prolifera,
      showing a significant effect of aquaculture on the bacterial community
      composition. This is the first systematic characterization of the bacterial
      community from a sponge found in the Chesapeake Bay. Changes in sponge bacterial 
      composition were observed in sponges maintained in aquaculture and demonstrate
      the importance of monitoring microbial communities when cultivating sponges in
      aquaculture systems.

TI  - Isolation and difference in anti-Staphylococcus aureus bioactivity of curvularin 
      derivates from fungus Eupenicillium sp.
PG  - 284-93
LID - 10.1007/s12010-009-8591-2 [doi]
AB  - With the anti-microbial and anti-tumor composite screening model, bioassay-guided
      fractionation led to the isolation of two structurally related bioactive
      compounds, curvularin and alphabeta-dehydrocurvularin, from ethyl acetate extract
      of Eupenicillium sp. associated with marine sponge Axinella sp. Further study on 
      the structure-activity relationship demonstrated that both compounds exhibited
      differences in bioactive profiles which are highly associated with their minor
      structural differences. Both curvularin and alphabeta-dehydrocurvularin have
      similar level of anti-fungal and anti-tumorous activity, while
      alphabeta-dehydrocurvularin is active against Staphylococcus aureus with a
      minimal inhibitory concentration of 375 microg/ml but curvularin does not. No
      detectable activity against Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa exists for both compounds. It is suggested that the
      partial planar backbone structure, due to the conjugation of pi electrons in the 
      presence of a 3,4-double bond and the carbonyl group at position C-2 in
      alphabeta-dehydrocurvularin, acts as a key factor for the inhibition of S.
      aureus, a Gram-positive low G + C bacteria that are often the hospital-acquired
      and/or community-acquired pathogen.

TI  - Diversity of bacteria in the marine sponge Aplysina fulva in Brazilian coastal
      waters.
PG  - 3331-43
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02101-08 [doi]
AB  - Microorganisms can account for up to 60% of the fresh weight of marine sponges.
      Marine sponges have been hypothesized to serve as accumulation spots of
      particular microbial communities, but it is unknown to what extent these
      communities are directed by the organism or the site or occur randomly. To
      address this question, we assessed the composition of specific bacterial
      communities associated with Aplysina fulva, one of the prevalent sponge species
      inhabiting Brazilian waters. Specimens of A. fulva and surrounding seawater were 
      collected in triplicate in shallow water at two sites, Caboclo Island and
      Tartaruga beach, Buzios, Brazil. Total community DNA was extracted from the
      samples using "direct" and "indirect" approaches. 16S rRNA-based PCR-denaturing
      gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analyses of the total bacterial community
      and of specific bacterial groups--Pseudomonas and Actinobacteria--revealed that
      the structure of these assemblages in A. fulva differed drastically from that
      observed in seawater. The DNA extraction methodology and sampling site were
      determinative for the composition of actinobacterial communities in A. fulva.
      However, no such effects could be gleaned from total bacterial and Pseudomonas
      PCR-DGGE profiles. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries constructed from
      directly and indirectly extracted DNA did not differ significantly with respect
      to diversity and composition. Altogether, the libraries encompassed 15 bacterial 
      phyla and the candidate division TM7. Clone sequences affiliated with the
      Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
      Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria were, in this order, most abundant. The
      bacterial communities associated with the A. fulva specimens were distinct and
      differed from those described in studies of sponge-associated microbiota
      performed with other sponge species.

TI  - Triphala incorporated collagen sponge--a smart biomaterial for infected dermal
      wound healing.
PG  - 162-70
LID - 10.1016/j.jss.2008.07.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wound infection is a major problem in the medical community since
      many types of wounds are more prone to microbial contamination leading to
      infection. Triphala (a traditional ayurvedic herbal formulation) incorporated
      collagen sponge was investigated for its healing potential on infected dermal
      wound in albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol extract of triphala was
      prepared and analyzed for the presence of catechin by high-pressure liquid
      chromatography analysis. Collagen sponge was prepared by incorporating triphala
      into collagen sponge. The triphala incorporated collagen was characterized by
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and
      water uptake analysis. Infected wound was dressed with triphala incorporated
      collagen sponge. Wound reduction rate, collagen content, and matrix
      metalloproteinases in the granulation tissue, histology, and Fourier transform
      electron microscopy analysis were done to obtain the healing pattern. RESULTS:
      High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed the presence of
      (-)epigallocatechin gallate. FT-IR spectroscopy study revealed the interaction of
      polyphenols with the collagen. Triphala incorporated collagen sponge has shown to
      increase thermal stability and water uptake capability, faster wound closure,
      improved tissue regeneration, collagen content at the wound site, and supporting 
      histopathological parameters pertaining to wound healing. Matrix
      metalloproteinases expression was correlated well with reduction in the
      inflammatory phase, thus confirming efficacy of the dressing. CONCLUSIONS: Better
      healing efficacy of triphala incorporated collagen sponge may provides a
      scientific rationale for the use of this dressing as an effective wound cover in 
      the management of infected dermal wound.

TI  - Molecular microbial diversity survey of sponge reproductive stages and
      mechanistic insights into vertical transmission of microbial symbionts.

AB  - Many marine sponges, hereafter termed high-microbial-abundance (HMA) sponges,
      harbor large and complex microbial consortia, including bacteria and archaea,
      within their mesohyl matrices. To investigate vertical microbial transmission as 
      a strategy to maintain these complex associations, an extensive phylogenetic
      analysis was carried out with the 16S rRNA gene sequences of reproductive (n =
      136) and adult (n = 88) material from five different Caribbean species, as well
      as all published 16S rRNA gene sequences from sponge offspring (n = 116). The
      overall microbial diversity, including members of at least 13 bacterial phyla and
      one archaeal phylum, in sponge reproductive stages is high. In total, 28
      vertical-transmission clusters, defined as clusters of phylotypes that are found 
      both in adult sponges and their offspring, were identified. They are distributed 
      among at least 10 bacterial phyla and one archaeal phylum, demonstrating that the
      complex adult microbial community is collectively transmitted through
      reproductive stages. Indications of host-species specificity and cospeciation
      were not observed. Mechanistic insights were provided using a combined electron
      microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, and an indirect
      mechanism of vertical transmission via nurse cells is proposed for the oviparous 
      sponge Ectyoplasia ferox. Based on these phylogenetic and mechanistic results, we
      suggest the following symbiont transmission model: entire microbial consortia are
      vertically transmitted in sponges. While vertical transmission is clearly
      present, additional environmental transfer between adult individuals of the same 
      and even different species might obscure possible signals of cospeciation. We
      propose that associations of HMA sponges with highly sponge-specific microbial
      communities are maintained by this combination of vertical and horizontal
      symbiont transmission.

PG  - 3366-76

AB  - The microbial community composition in affected and unaffected portions of
      diseased sponges and healthy control sponges of Aplysina aerophoba was assessed
      to ascertain the role of microbes in the disease process. Sponge secondary
      metabolites were also examined to assess chemical shifts in response to
      infection. The microbial profile and aplysinimine levels in unaffected tissue
      near the lesions closely reflected those of healthy sponge tissue, indicating a
      highly localized disease process. DGGE detected multiple sequences that were
      exclusively present in diseased sponges. Most notably, a Deltaproteobacteria
      sequence with high homology to a coral black band disease strain was detected in 
      all sponge lesions and was absent from all healthy and unaffected regions of
      diseased sponges. Other potential pathogens identified by DGGE include an
      environmental Cytophaga strain and a novel Epsilonproteobacteria strain with no
      known close relatives. The disease process also caused a major shift in
      prokaryote community structure at a very high taxonomic level. Using 16S rRNA
      gene sequence analysis, only the diseased sponges were found to contain sequences
      belonging to the Epsilonproteobacteria and Firmicutes, and there was a much
      greater number of Bacteroidetes sequences within the diseased sponges. In
      contrast, only the healthy sponges contained sequences corresponding to the
      cyanobacteria and 'OP1' candidate division, and the healthy sponges were
      dominated by Chloroflexi and Gammaproteobacteria sequences. Overall bacterial
      diversity was found to be considerably higher in diseased sponges than in healthy
      sponges. These results provide a platform for future cultivation-based
      experiments to isolate the putative pathogens from A. aerophoba and perform
      re-infection trials to define the disease aetiology.

PG  - 435-41
AB  - The microbial community of Baikal sponges has been studied in five species
      belonging to the genera Swartschewskia, Baicalospongia, and Lubomirskia of the
      endemic family Lubomirskiidae. The results show that the total numbers of
      bacteria and bacterioplankton production have an effect on the growth of L.
      baicalensis body. Bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Micrococcus,
      Sarcina, Flavobacterium, Arthrobacter, and Acinetobacter living in the sponges
      are representatives of the Baikal bacterioplankton. Actinomycetes of the genera
      Streptomyces and Micromonospora are a permanent component of the cultivable
      sponge microbial community. The numbers and enzyme activities of heterotrophic,
      oligotrophic, and psychrophilic bacteria isolated from different sponge species
      and the surrounding water in autumn and in winter have been estimated.

      marine sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile was assessed. Sponges were exposed to
      temperatures ranging between 27 and 33 degrees C. No differences in bacterial
      community composition or sponge health were detected in treatments between 27 and
      31 degrees C. In contrast, sponges exposed to 33 degrees C exhibited a complete
      loss of the primary cultivated symbiont within 24 h and cellular necrosis after 3
      days. Furthermore, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone
      sequence analysis detected a dramatic shift in bacterial community composition
      between 31 and 33 degrees C. Within the first 24 h most of the DGGE bands
      detected in samples from 27 to 31 degrees C were absent from the 33 degrees C
      sponges whereas eight bands were detected exclusively in the 33 degrees C
      sponges. The 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that most of the microbes from sponges 
      exposed to 27-31 degrees C had highest homology to known sponge-associated
      bacteria. In contrast, many of the microbes from sponges exposed to 33 degrees C 
      were similar to sequences previously retrieved from diseased and bleached corals.
      The 16S rRNA clone library analysis also detected a significant shift in
      bacterial community structure. The 27 degrees C library was composed of
      Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Nitrospira, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi whereas
      the 33 degrees C library contained sequences from the Proteobacteria,
      Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The clear shifts in community composition at
      elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of symbionts and to the
      establishment of alien microbial populations including potential pathogens.
      Breakdown of symbioses and stress in the sponge occurred at temperatures
      identical to those reported for coral bleaching, indicating that sponges may be
      similarly threatened by climate change.

TI  - Monitoring bacterial diversity of the marine sponge Ircinia strobilina upon
      transfer into aquaculture.
PG  - 4133-43
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00454-08 [doi]
AB  - Marine sponges in the genus Ircinia are known to be good sources of secondary
      metabolites with biological activities. A major obstacle in the development of
      sponge-derived metabolites is the difficulty in ensuring an economic, sustainable
      supply of the metabolites. A promising strategy is the ex situ culture of sponges
      in closed or semiclosed aquaculture systems. In this study, the marine sponge
      Ircinia strobilina (order Dictyoceratida: family Irciniidae) was collected from
      the wild and maintained for a year in a recirculating aquaculture system.
      Microbiological and molecular community analyses were performed on freshly
      collected sponges and sponges maintained in aquaculture for 3 months and 9
      months. Chemical analyses were performed on wild collected sponges and
      individuals maintained in aquaculture for 3 months and 1 year. Denaturing
      gradient gel electrophoresis was used to assess the complexity of and to monitor 
      changes in the microbial communities associated with I. strobilina. Culture-based
      and molecular techniques showed an increase in the Bacteroidetes and Alpha- and
      Gammaproteobacteria components of the bacterial community in aquaculture.
      Populations affiliated with Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria, Clostridia, and
      Planctomycetes emerged in sponges maintained in aquaculture. The diversity of
      bacterial communities increased upon transfer into aquaculture.

TI  - Physiology, phylogeny and in situ evidence for bacterial and archaeal nitrifiers 
      in the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba.
PG  - 2942-55

AB  - The potential for nitrification in the Mediterranean sponge Aplysina aerophoba
      was assessed using a combined physiological and molecular approach. Nitrate
      excretion rates in whole sponges reached values of up to 344 nmol g(-1) dry
      weight (wt) h(-1) (unstimulated) and 1325 nmol g(-1) dry wt h(-1) (stimulated).
      Addition of nitrapyrin, a nitrification-specific inhibitor, effectively inhibited
      nitrate excretion. Ammonium was taken up by sponges in spring and excreted in
      fall, the sponges thus serving as either an ammonium sink or ammonium source.
      Nitrosospira cluster 1 and Crenarchaeota group I.1A 16S rRNA and amoA genes were 
      recovered from A. aerophoba and other sponges from different world's oceans. The 
      archaeal 16S rRNA genes formed a sponge-specific subcluster, indicating that
      their representatives are members of the stable microbial community of sponges.
      On the other hand, clustering was not evident for Nitrosospira rRNA genes which
      is consistent with their presence in sediment and seawater samples. The presence 
      of both Nitrosospira cluster 1 and crenarchaeal group 1 phylotypes in sponge
      tissue was confirmed using fluorescently labelled 16S rRNA gene probes. This
      study contributes to an ongoing effort to link microbial diversity with metabolic
      functions in the phylogenetically diverse, elusive and so far uncultivated
      microbial communities of marine sponges.

TI  - Microbial community that catalyzes partial nitrification at low oxygen atmosphere
      as revealed by 16S rRNA and amoA genes.
PG  - 525-8
LID - 10.1263/jbb.104.525 [doi]
AB  - We previously reported that partial nitrification in the down-flow hanging sponge
      (DHS) system was satisfactorily accomplished under oxygen-limited conditions
      [Chuang et al., Water Res., 41, 295-302 (2007)]. In this study, we investigated
      the microbes that are responsible for the partial nitrification in this unique
      system by 16S rRNA- and amoA-based cloning analyses and fluorescence in situ
      hybridization. Microbes related to Nitrosomonas species were found to be chiefly 
      responsible for catalyzing the partial nitrification. Microbes affiliated with
      the uncultivated phyla OP10 and Bacteroidetes were also numerous in the DHS, but 
      their ecological niches are still unknown.

TI  - Phylogenetic diversity and spatial distribution of the microbial community
      associated with the Caribbean deep-water sponge Polymastia cf. corticata by 16S
      rRNA, aprA, and amoA gene analysis.
PG  - 306-21
LID - 10.1007/s00248-007-9348-5 [doi]
AB  - Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)-based analyses of 16S rRNA, aprA, 
      and amoA genes demonstrated that a phylogenetically diverse and complex microbial
      community was associated with the Caribbean deep-water sponge Polymastia cf.
      corticata Ridley and Dendy, 1887. From the 38 archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA
      phylotypes identified, 53% branched into the sponge-specific, monophyletic
      sequence clusters determined by previous studies (considering predominantly
      shallow-water sponge species), whereas 26% appeared to be P. cf. corticata
      specifically associated microorganisms ("specialists"); 21% of the phylotypes
      were confirmed to represent seawater- and sediment-derived proteobacterial
      species ("contaminants") acquired by filtration processes from the host
      environment. Consistently, the aprA and amoA gene-based analyses indicated the
      presence of environmentally derived sulfur- and ammonia-oxidizers besides
      putative sponge-specific sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria and
      Alphaproteobacteria and a sulfate-reducing archaeon. A sponge-specific,
      endosymbiotic sulfur cycle as described for marine oligochaetes is proposed to be
      also present in P. cf. corticata. Overall, the results of this work support the
      recent studies that demonstrated the sponge species specificity of the associated
      microbial community while the biogeography of the host collection site has only a
      minor influence on the composition. In P. cf. corticata, the specificity of the
      sponge-microbe associations is even extended to the spatial distribution of the
      microorganisms within the sponge body; distinct bacterial populations were
      associated with the different tissue sections, papillae, outer and inner cortex, 
      and choanosome. The local distribution of a phylotype within P. cf. corticata
      correlated with its (1) phylogenetic affiliation, (2) classification as
      sponge-specific or nonspecifically associated microorganism, and (3) potential
      ecological role in the host sponge.

TI  - Cultivable bacterial community from South China Sea sponge as revealed by DGGE
      fingerprinting and 16S rDNA phylogenetic analysis.
PG  - 465-72
AB  - The cultivable bacterial communities associated with four South China Sea
      sponges-Stelletta tenuis, Halichondria rugosa, Dysidea avara, and Craniella
      australiensis in mixed cultures-were investigated by microbial community
      DNA-based DGGE fingerprinting and 16S rDNA phylogenetic analysis. Diverse
      bacteria such as alpha-, gamma-, delta-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and
      Firmicutes were cultured, some of which were previously uncultivable bacteria,
      potential novel strains with less than 95% similarity to their closest relatives 
      and sponge symbionts growing only in the medium with the addition of sponge
      extract. According to 16S rDNA BLAST analysis, most of the bacteria were cultured
      from sponge for the first time, although similar phyla of bacteria have been
      previously recognized. The selective pressure of sponge extract on the cultured
      bacterial species was suggested, although the effect of sponge extract on
      bacterial community in high nutrient medium is not significant. Although alpha-
      and gamma-Proteobacteria appeared to form the majority of the dominant cultivable
      bacterial communities of the four sponges, the composition of the cultivable
      bacterial community in the mixed culture was different, depending on the medium
      and sponge species. Greater bacterial diversity was observed in media C and CS
      for Stelletta tenuis, in media F and FS for Halichondria rugosa and Craniella
      australiensis. S. tenuis was found to have the highest cultivable bacterial
      diversity including alpha-, gamma-, delta-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and
      Firmicutes, followed by sponge Dysidea avara without delta-Proteobacteria, sponge
      Halichondria rugosa with only alpha-, gamma-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and
      sponge C. australiensis with only alpha-, gamma-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.
      Based on this study, by the strategy of mixed cultivation integrated with
      microbial community DNA-based DGGE fingerprinting and phylogenetic analysis, the 
      cultivable bacterial community of sponge could be revealed effectively.

TI  - Analysis of the nitrifying bacterial community in BioCube sponge media using
      fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and microelectrodes.
PG  - 1426-35
AB  - There is growing interest in the development of more cost-effective and retrofit 
      technologies for the upgrade and expansion of existing wastewater treatment
      plants with extreme space constraints. A free-floating sponge media (BioCube)
      process, using a 24 L lab scale reactor, was operated to study the nitrification 
      profiles and microbial community. The COD removal efficiencies were maintained,
      at an average of 95%, with the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) inside the
      BioCube sponge media maintained at 12,688 mg/L. The nitrification removal
      efficiencies were between 92% and 100%, with an average value of 99%. From the
      results of microelectrode measurements, the ammonium ion concentration was found 
      to rapidly decrease from the surface of the BioCube sponge media to a depth of
      2mm due to chemical reactions carried out by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB)
      species. Multi-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used to
      investigate the spatial distributions of various microbial activities within
      reactors. Microbial communities were targeted using different oligonucleotide
      probes specific to AOB and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). There were a large
      number of AOB populations, but these were not uniformly distributed in the
      biofilm compared to the NOB populations.

TI  - Use of real-time qPCR to quantify members of the unculturable heterotrophic
      bacterial community in a deep sea marine sponge, Vetulina sp.
PG  - 384-94
AB  - In this report, real-time quantitative PCR (TaqMan qPCR) of the small subunit
      (SSU) 16S-like rRNA molecule, a universal phylogenetic marker, was used to
      quantify the relative abundance of individual bacterial members of a diverse, yet
      mostly unculturable, microbial community from a marine sponge. Molecular
      phylogenetic analyses of bacterial communities derived from Caribbean Lithistid
      sponges have shown a wide diversity of microbes that included at least six major 
      subdivisions; however, very little overlap was observed between the culturable
      and unculturable microbial communities. Based on sequence data of three
      culture-independent Lithistid-derived representative bacteria, we designed
      probe/primer sets for TaqMan qPCR to quantitatively characterize selected
      microbial residents in a Lithistid sponge, Vetulina, metagenome. TaqMan assays
      included specificity testing, DNA limit of detection analysis, and quantification
      of specific microbial rRNA sequences such as Nitrospira-like microbes and
      Actinobacteria up to 172 million copies per microgram per Lithistid sponge
      metagenome. By contrast, qPCR amplification with probes designed for common
      previously cultured sponge-associated bacteria in the genera Rheinheimera and
      Marinomonas and a representative of the CFB group resulted in only minimal
      detection of the Rheiheimera in total DNA extracted from the sponge. These data
      verify that a large portion of the microbial community within Lithistid sponges
      may consist of currently unculturable microorganisms.

TI  - Abundance and bioactivity of cultured sponge-associated bacteria from the
      Mediterranean sea.
PG  - 94-106
AB  - In this study, the search for new antibiotics was combined with quantitative
      ecological studies. The cultured fraction of the associated bacterial communities
      from ten different Mediterranean sponge species was investigated. To obtain
      quantitative and qualitative data of sponge-associated bacterial communities and 
      to expand the cultured diversity, different media were used. The largest
      morphological diversity and highest yield of isolates was obtained by using
      oligotrophic media, which consisted of natural habitat seawater amended with (1% 
      additional carbon sources. The dominant bacterial morphotypes were determined and
      bacterial isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity and identified using
      16S rDNA sequencing. The sponge-associated most abundant morphotypes were all
      affiliated to the Alphaproteobacteria and showed antimicrobial activity against
      at least one of the tested strains. In contrast, the ambient seawater was
      dominated by Gammaproteobacteria. One single alphaproteobacterium, which was
      related to Pseudovibrio denitrificans, was shown to dominate the cultured
      community of at least six of the sponges. This designated MBIC3368-like
      alphaproteobacterium has been isolated from sponges before and seems to be
      restricted to associations with members of the phylum Porifera. It displays a
      weak and unstable antimicrobial activity, which gets easily lost during
      cultivation. However, this bioactive bacterium was present in the sponges by up
      to 10(6) cells per gram wet-weight sponge tissue and dominated the cultured
      fraction with up to 74%. The association of this alphaproteobacterium with
      sponges is probably evolutionary young and facultative and possibly involves
      biologically active secondary metabolites. Besides a demonstrated vertical
      transfer, additional horizontal transfer between the sponges is assumed. Members 
      of the genus Bacillus displaying antimicrobial activity were found regularly,
      too. However, actinomycetes, which are known for their production of bioactive
      substances, were present in very low abundance.

TI  - Sponge-specific bacterial associations of the Mediterranean sponge Chondrilla
      nucula (Demospongiae, Tetractinomorpha).
PG  - 101-11
AB  - A stable and specific bacterial community was shown to be associated with the
      Mediterranean sponge Chondrilla nucula. The associated bacterial communities were
      demonstrated to be highly similar for all studied specimens regardless of
      sampling time and geographical region. In addition, analysis of 16S rDNA clone
      libraries revealed three constantly C. nucula-associated bacterial phylotypes
      belonging to the Acidobacteria, the Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria present in
      sponge specimens from two Mediterranean regions with distinct water masses
      (Ligurian Sea and Adriatic Sea). For the first time, candidate division TM7
      bacteria were found in marine sponges. A major part (79%) of the C.
      nucula-derived 16S rDNA sequences were closely related to other sponge-associated
      bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis identified 14 16S rRNA gene sequence clusters,
      seven of which consisted of exclusively sponge-derived sequences, whereas the
      other seven clusters contained additional environmental sequences. This study
      adds to a growing database on the stability and variability of microbial
      consortia associated with marine sponges.

TI  - Metagenomic approaches to exploit the biotechnological potential of the microbial
      consortia of marine sponges.
PG  - 11-20
AB  - Natural products isolated from sponges are an important source of new
      biologically active compounds. However, the development of these compounds into
      drugs has been held back by the difficulties in achieving a sustainable supply of
      these often-complex molecules for pre-clinical and clinical development.
      Increasing evidence implicates microbial symbionts as the source of many of these
      biologically active compounds, but the vast majority of the sponge microbial
      community remain uncultured. Metagenomics offers a biotechnological solution to
      this supply problem. Metagenomes of sponge microbial communities have been shown 
      to contain genes and gene clusters typical for the biosynthesis of biologically
      active natural products. Heterologous expression approaches have also led to the 
      isolation of secondary metabolism gene clusters from uncultured microbial
      symbionts of marine invertebrates and from soil metagenomic libraries. Combining 
      a metagenomic approach with heterologous expression holds much promise for the
      sustainable exploitation of the chemical diversity present in the sponge
      microbial community.

TI  - Vertical transmission of a phylogenetically complex microbial consortium in the
      viviparous sponge Ircinia felix.
PG  - 2067-78
AB  - Many marine demosponges contain large amounts of phylogenetically complex yet
      highly sponge-specific microbial consortia within the mesohyl matrix, but little 
      is known about how these microorganisms are acquired by their hosts. Settlement
      experiments were performed with the viviparous Caribbean demosponge Ircinia felix
      to investigate the role of larvae in the vertical transmission of the
      sponge-associated microbial community. Inspections by electron microscopy
      revealed large amounts of morphologically diverse microorganisms in the center of
      I. felix larvae, while the outer rim appeared to be devoid of microorganisms. In 
      juveniles, microorganisms were found between densely packed sponge cells.
      Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was performed to compare the
      bacterial community profiles of adults, larvae, and juvenile sponges. Adults and 
      larvae were highly similar in DGGE band numbers and banding patterns. Larvae
      released by the same adult individual contained highly similar DGGE banding
      patterns, whereas larvae released by different adult individuals showed slightly 
      different DGGE banding patterns. Over 200 bands were excised, sequenced, and
      phylogenetically analyzed. The bacterial diversity of adult I. felix and its
      larvae was comparably high, while juveniles showed reduced diversity. In total,
      13 vertically transmitted sequence clusters, hereafter termed "IF clusters," that
      contained sequences from both the adult sponge and offspring (larvae and/or
      juveniles) were found. The IF clusters belonged to at least four different
      eubacterial phyla and one possibly novel eubacterial lineage. In summary, it
      could be shown that in I. felix, vertical transmission of microorganisms through 
      the larvae is an important mechanism for the establishment of the sponge-microbe 
      association.

TI  - Bacterial community structure associated with the Antarctic soft coral, Alcyonium
      antarcticum.
PG  - 81-94
AB  - The structure and composition of microbial communities inhabiting the soft coral 
      Alcyonium antarcticum were investigated across three differentially contaminated 
      sites within McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Diverse microbial communities were
      revealed at all sites using culture-based analysis, denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE), 16S rRNA gene clone-library analysis, and FISH.
      Phylogenetic analysis of isolates and retrieved sequences demonstrated close
      affiliation with known psychrophiles from the Antarctic environment and high
      similarity to Gammaproteobacteria clades of sponge-associated microorganisms. The
      majority of bacteria detected with all techniques reside within the
      Gammaproteobacteria, although other phylogenetic groups including Alpha- and
      Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinomycetales, Planctomycetes,
      and Chlorobi and bacteria from the functional group of sulfate-reducing bacteria 
      were also present. Multivariate (nMDS) analysis of DGGE banding patterns and
      principal component analysis of quantitative FISH data revealed no distinct
      differences in community composition between differentially contaminated sites.
      Rather, conserved coral-associated bacterial groups were observed within and
      between sites, providing evidence to support specific coral-microbial
      interactions. This is the first investigation of microbial communities associated
      with Antarctic soft corals, and the results suggest that spatially stable
      microbial associations exist across an environmental impact gradient.

TI  - [Revelation and phylogenetic analysis of the predominant bacterial community
      associated with sponges in the South China Sea based on PCR- DGGE fingerprints].
PG  - 487-91
AB  - The predominant bacterial community structure of Dysidea avara and Craniella
      australiensis in the South China Sea were revealed by PCR- DGGE fingerprinting in
      the present study. With further cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, it
      was found that Proteobacteria predominated in these two sponges.
      Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were found in
      Dysidea avara and only Gammaproteobacteria found in Craniella australiensis.
      Although Bacteroidetes were found in both sponges, they differed in the species. 
      These bacteria were found in sponges firstly. The bacteria in Craniella
      australiensis show more complex diversity than that in Dysidea avara. Because
      compared with Dysidea avara, Craniella australiensis include Actinobacteria,
      Firmicutes, etc. The bacterial community diversity in these two sponges indicates
      that the sponge-associated bacteria are host-specific even if the hosts are from 
      the same marine location. DGGE fingerprint-based analysis should integrate with
      band cloning and sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, etc., molecular techniques to
      get precise results for the microbial community and diversity revelation. The
      research of studying sponge microbe by DGGE technique is initial work, that will 
      accelerate the development of sponge microorganisms item.

      approaches.
PG  - 1460-70
AB  - Diverse ketosynthase (KS) genes were retrieved from the microbial community
      associated with the Great Barrier Reef sponge Pseudoceratina clavata. Bacterial
      isolation and metagenomic approaches were employed. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S 
      rRNA of culturable sponge-associated bacterial communities comprised eight groups
      over four phyla. Ten KS domains were amplified from four genera of isolates and
      phylogenetics demonstrated that these KS domains were located in three clusters
      (actinobacterial, cyanobacterial and trans-AT type). Metagenomic DNA of the
      sponge microbial community was extracted to explore community KS genes by two
      approaches: direct amplification of KS domains and construction of fosmid
      libraries for KS domain screening. Five KS domains were retrieved from polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) amplification using sponge metagenome DNA as template and
      five fosmid clones containing KS domains found using multiplex PCR screening.
      Analysis of selected polyketide synthase (PKS) from one fosmid showed that the
      PKS consists of two modules. Open reading frames located up- and downstream of
      the PKS displayed similarity with membrane synthesis-related proteins such as
      cardiolipin synthase. Metagenome approaches did not detect KS domains found in
      sponge isolates. All KS domains from both metagenome approaches formed a single
      cluster with KS domains originating from metagenomes derived from other sponge
      species from other geographical regions.

TI  - Monitoring microbial community composition by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
      during cultivation of the marine cold-water sponge Geodia barretti.
PG  - 373-9
AB  - To determine the stability and specificity of microbes associated with the marine
      cold-water sponge Geodia barretti during cultivation, we compared the microbial
      community of freshly retrieved specimens to that of cultivated explants by
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). G. barretti hosts a specific
      homogeneous microbial community in its mesohyl, which is maintained during a
      cultivation period of 8 months. In 10-day-old explants, bright colonies of
      unusually large bacterial cells, located predominantly at canal walls, were
      observed in addition to the common bacteria. Bacteria of the aberrant type
      included both lineages present in whole sponges and foreign ones, notably
      numerous genera of sulfate-reducing bacteria. We assume that these represent
      infectious bacteria that eluded the innate immune system of the sponge. Explants 
      that resist these microbial attacks during the critical phase of cultivation
      eliminate infectious bacteria. The intrinsic microbial community of G. barretti
      is not affected by these infections and remains persistent over a cultivation
      period of at least several months.

TI  - Analysis of the first genome fragment from the marine sponge-associated, novel
      candidate phylum Poribacteria by environmental genomics.
PG  - 612-24
AB  - The novel candidate phylum Poribacteria is specifically associated with several
      marine demosponge genera. Because no representatives of Poribacteria have been
      cultivated, an environmental genomic approach was used to gain insights into
      genomic properties and possibly physiological/functional features of this elusive
      candidate division. In a large-insert library harbouring an estimated 1.1 Gb of
      microbial community DNA from Aplysina aerophoba, a Poribacteria-positive 16S rRNA
      gene locus was identified. Sequencing and sequence annotation of the 39 kb size
      insert revealed 27 open reading frames (ORFs) and two genes for stable RNAs. The 
      fragment exhibited an overall G+C content of 50.5% and a coding density of 86.1%.
      The 16S rRNA gene was unlinked from a conventional rrn operon. Its flanking
      regions did not show any synteny to other 16S rRNA encoding loci from
      microorganisms with unlinked rrn operons. Two of the predicted hypothetical
      proteins were highly similar to homologues from Rhodopirellula baltica.
      Furthermore, a novel kind of molybdenum containing oxidoreductase was predicted
      as well as a series of eight ORFs encoding for unusual transporters, channel or
      pore forming proteins. This environmental genomics approach provides, for the
      first time, genomic and, by inference, functional information on the so far
      uncultivated, sponge-associated candidate division Poribacteria.

TI  - Culturable bacterial symbionts isolated from two distinct sponge species
      (Pseudoceratina clavata and Rhabdastrella globostellata) from the Great Barrier
      Reef display similar phylogenetic diversity.
PG  - 213-20
AB  - The diversity of the culturable microbial communities was examined in two sponge 
      species-Pseudoceratina clavata and Rhabdastrella globostellata. Isolates were
      characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The
      bacterial community structures represented in both sponges were found to be
      similar at the phylum level by the same four phyla in this study and also at a
      finer scale at the species level in both Firmicutes and Alphaproteobacteria. The 
      majority of the Alphaproteobacteria isolates were most closely related to
      isolates from other sponge species including alpha proteobacterium NW001 sp. and 
      alpha proteobacterium MBIC3368. Members of the low %G + C gram-positive (phylum
      Firmicutes), high %G + C gram-positive (phylum Actinobacteria), and
      Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (phylum Bacteroidetes) phyla of domain
      Bacteria were also represented in both sponges. In terms of culturable organisms,
      taxonomic diversity of the microbial community in the two sponge species displays
      similar structure at phylum level. Within phyla, isolates often belonged to the
      same genus-level monophyletic group. Community structure and taxonomic
      composition in the two sponge species P. clavata and Rha. globostellata share
      significant features with those of other sponge species including those from
      widely separated geographical and climatic regions of the sea.

TI  - Microbial diversity of the freshwater sponge Spongilla lacustris.
PG  - 206-12
AB  - To provide insight into the phylogenetic bacterial diversity of the freshwater
      sponge Spongilla lacustris, a 16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed from
      sponge tissues and from lake water. Restriction fragment length polymorphism
      (RFLP) analysis of >190 freshwater sponge-derived clones resulted in six major
      restriction patterns, from which 45 clones were chosen for sequencing. The
      resulting sequences were affiliated with the Alpha proteobacteria (n=19), the
      Actinobacteria (n=15), the Beta proteobacteria (n=2), and the Chloroflexi (n=2)
      lineages. About half of the sequences belonged to previously described
      actinobacterial (hgc-I) and beta proteobacterial (beta-II) sequence clusters of
      freshwater bacteria that were also present in the lake water 16S rRNA gene
      library. At least two novel, deeply rooting alpha proteobacterial lineages were
      recovered from S. lacustris that showed <89% sequence similarity to known
      phylogenetic groups. Electron microscopical observations revealed that digested
      bacterial remnants were contained within food vacuoles of sponge archaeocytes,
      whereas the extracellular matrix was virtually free of bacteria. This study is
      the first molecular diversity study of a freshwater sponge and adds to a growing 
      database on the diversity and community composition of sponge-associated
      microbial consortia.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis reveals diverse polyketide synthase gene clusters in
      microorganisms associated with the marine sponge Discodermia dissoluta.
PG  - 4840-9
AB  - Sponge-associated bacteria are thought to produce many novel bioactive compounds,
      including polyketides. PCR amplification of ketosynthase domains of type I
      modular polyketide synthases (PKS) from the microbial community of the marine
      sponge Discodermia dissoluta revealed great diversity and a novel group of
      sponge-specific PKS ketosynthase domains. Metagenomic libraries totaling more
      than four gigabases of bacterial genomes associated with this sponge were
      screened for type I modular PKS gene clusters. More than 90% of the clones in
      total sponge DNA libraries represented bacterial DNA inserts, and 0.7% harbored
      PKS genes. The majority of the PKS hybridizing clones carried small PKS clusters 
      of one to three modules, although some clones encoded large multimodular PKSs
      (more than five modules). The most abundant large modular PKS appeared to be
      encoded by a bacterial symbiont that made up < 1% of the sponge community.
      Sequencing of this PKS revealed 14 modules that, if expressed and active, is
      predicted to produce a multimethyl-branched fatty acid reminiscent of
      mycobacterial lipid components. Metagenomic libraries made from fractions
      enriched for unicellular or filamentous bacteria differed significantly, with the
      latter containing numerous nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and mixed
      NRPS-PKS gene clusters. The filamentous bacterial community of D. dissoluta
      consists mainly of Entotheonella spp., an unculturable sponge-specific taxon
      previously implicated in the biosynthesis of bioactive peptides.

TI  - Microbial diversity of marine sponges.
PG  - 59-88
AB  - The recent application of molecular microbial ecology tools to sponge-microbe
      associations has revealed a glimpse into the biodiversity of these microbial
      communities, that is considered just 'the tip of the iceberg'. This chapter
      provides an overview over these new findings with regard to identity, diversity
      and distribution patterns of sponge-associated microbial consortia. The sponges
      Aplysina aerophoba (Verongida), Rhopaloeides odorabile (Dicytoceratida) and
      Theonella swinhoei (Lithistida) were chosen as model systems for this review
      because they have been subject to both, cultivation-dependent and
      cultivation-independent approaches. A discussion of the microbial assemblages of 
      Halichondriapanicea is presented in the accompanying chapter by Imhoff and Stohr.
      Considering that a large fraction of sponge-associated microbes is not yet
      amenable to cultivation, an emphasis has been placed on the techniques centering 
      around the 16S rRNA gene. A section has been included that covers the potential
      of sponge microbial communities for drug discovery. Finally, a 'sponge-microbe
      interaction model' is presented that summarizes our current understanding of the 
      processes that might have shaped the community structure of the microbial
      assemblages within sponges.

TI  - Biogeography of bacteria associated with the marine sponge Cymbastela
      concentrica.
PG  - 419-33
AB  - Recent debate regarding microbial biogeography has focused largely on free-living
      microbes, yet those microbes associated with host organisms are also of interest 
      from a biogeographical perspective. Marine eukaryotes and associated bacteria
      should provide ideal systems in which to consider microbial biogeography, as (i) 
      bacteria in seawater should be able to disperse among individuals of the same
      host species, yet (ii) potential for adaptation to particular hosts (and thus
      speciation) also exists. We used 16S rDNA-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis) to examine geographic variability in bacterial community
      composition in the marine sponge Cymbastela concentrica. Denaturing gradient gel 
      electrophoresis banding patterns (and phylogenetic analysis of excised DGGE
      bands) indicated different communities in Cymbastela concentrica from tropical
      versus temperate Australia. In contrast, communities were very similar over a
      500-km portion of the sponge's temperate range. Variation in bacterial community 
      composition was also considered with respect to ocean current patterns. We
      speculate that the divergent communities in different parts of the sponge's range
      provide evidence of endemism attributed to host association, although variation
      in environmental factors such as light and temperature could also explain the
      observed results. Interestingly, bacterial communities in seawater varied much
      less between tropical and temperate locations than did those in C. concentrica,
      supporting the concept of widespread dispersal among these free-living microbes.

TI  - Host specificity in marine sponge-associated bacteria, and potential implications
      for marine microbial diversity.
PG  - 121-30
AB  - Biodiversity is fundamental to both eukaryote and prokaryote ecology, yet
      investigations of diversity often differ markedly between the two disciplines.
      Host specificity - the association of organisms with only a few (specialism) or
      many (generalism) host species - is recognized within eukaryote ecology as a key 
      determinant of diversity. In contrast, its implications for microbial diversity
      have received relatively little attention. Here we explore the relationship
      between microbial diversity and host specificity using marine sponge-bacteria
      associations. We used a replicated, hierarchical sampling design and both 16S
      rDNA- and rpoB-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to examine
      whether three co-occurring sponges from temperate Australia -Cymbastela
      concentrica, Callyspongia sp. and Stylinos sp. - contained unique, specialized
      communities of microbes. Microbial communities varied little within each species 
      of sponge, but variability among species was substantial. Over five seasons, the 
      microbial community in C. concentrica differed significantly from other sponges, 
      which were more similar to seawater. Overall, three types of sponge-associated
      bacteria were identified via 16S rDNA sequencing of excised DGGE bands:
      'specialists'- found on only one host species, 'sponge associates'- found on
      multiple hosts but not in seawater, and 'generalists' from multiple hosts and
      seawater. Analogous to other high diversity systems, the degree of specificity of
      prokaryotes to host eukaryotes could have a potentially significant effect on
      estimates of marine microbial diversity.

TI  - A bacterial culture-independent method to investigate chemically mediated control
      of bacterial epibiosis in marine invertebrates by using TRFLP analysis and
      natural bacterial populations.
PG  - 93-9
LID - 10.1016/S0168-6496(03)00246-0 [doi]
AB  - It has been postulated that a variety of physically undefended marine
      invertebrates have evolved strategies to control microbial epibiosis chemically. 
      Ecologically meaningful experiments that demonstrate chemically mediated
      antibacterial effects are difficult due to the small number of cultivable
      bacteria. Based on the example of three sponges, this study introduces a
      culture-independent methodology to investigate chemically mediated control of
      bacterial epibiosis by analyzing the natural bacterial consortia. Organic
      extracts of sponges were immobilized in hydrogels at tissue level concentrations 
      and exposed to the same source of natural seawater for bacterial colonization.
      Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain
      reaction-amplified bacterial community DNA obtained from these gels was shown to 
      be a useful tool to study bacterial community shifts in response to sponge
      metabolites by comparing bacterial ribotypes obtained from the gel surfaces.
      Several terminal restriction fragments were absent relative to the control
      suggesting that settlement of specific bacteria was prevented. On the other hand,
      additional fragments occurred in some treatments, coinciding with higher
      bacterial abundance evidenced by DAPI counts of bacterial cells, indicating the
      bacterial utilization of sponge extract components. The advantages of this method
      are (1) a culture-independent approach, i.e. the assessment of antimicrobial
      activities against natural bacterial communities, (2) no restriction to
      particular modes of microbial colonization, i.e. antibiotic and repellant, and
      (3) the in situ assessment of antimicrobial compounds under flow conditions.

TI  - Manadomanzamines A and B: a novel alkaloid ring system with potent activity
      against mycobacteria and HIV-1.
PG  - 13382-6
AB  - Two novel alkaloids, named manadomanzamines A (1) and B (2), were isolated from
      an Indonesian sponge Acanthostrongylophora sp. (Haplosclerida: Petrosiidae).
      Their structures were elucidated and shown to be a novel organic skeleton related
      to the manzamine type alkaloids. Their absolute configuration and conformation
      were determined by CD, NOESY, and molecular modeling analysis. The microbial
      community analysis for the sponge that produces these unprecedented alkaloids has
      also been completed. Manadomanzamines A (1) and B (2) exhibited strong activity
      against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with MIC values of 1.9 and 1.5 mug/mL,
      respectively. Manadomanzamines A and B also exhibit activities against human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and AIDS opportunistic fungal infections.

TI  - Molecular evidence for a uniform microbial community in sponges from different
      oceans.
PG  - 4431-40
AB  - Sponges (class Porifera) are evolutionarily ancient metazoans that populate the
      tropical oceans in great abundances but also occur in temperate regions and even 
      in freshwater. Sponges contain large numbers of bacteria that are embedded within
      the animal matrix. The phylogeny of these bacteria and the evolutionary age of
      the interaction are virtually unknown. In order to provide insights into the
      species richness of the microbial community of sponges, we performed a
      comprehensive diversity survey based on 190 sponge-derived 16S ribosomal DNA
      (rDNA) sequences. The sponges Aplysina aerophoba and Theonella swinhoei were
      chosen for construction of the bacterial 16S rDNA library because they are
      taxonomically distantly related and they populate nonoverlapping geographic
      regions. In both sponges, a uniform microbial community was discovered whose
      phylogenetic signature is distinctly different from that of marine plankton or
      marine sediments. Altogether 14 monophyletic, sponge-specific sequence clusters
      were identified that belong to at least seven different bacterial divisions. By
      definition, the sequences of each cluster are more closely related to each other 
      than to a sequence from nonsponge sources. These monophyletic clusters comprise
      70% of all publicly available sponge-derived 16S rDNA sequences, reflecting the
      generality of the observed phenomenon. This shared microbial fraction represents 
      the smallest common denominator of the sponges investigated in this study.
      Bacteria that are exclusively found in certain host species or that occur only
      transiently would have been missed. A picture emerges where sponges can be viewed
      as highly concentrated reservoirs of so far uncultured and elusive marine
      microorganisms.

TI  - The effects of copper on the microbial community of a coral reef sponge.
PG  - 19-31
AB  - Marine sponges often harbour communities of symbiotic microorganisms that fulfil 
      necessary functions for the well-being of their hosts. Microbial communities
      associated with the sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile were used as bioindicators for 
      sublethal cupric ion (Cu2+) stress. A combined strategy incorporating molecular, 
      cultivation and electron microscopy techniques was adopted to monitor changes in 
      microbial diversity. The total density of sponge-associated bacteria and counts
      of the predominant cultivated symbiont (alpha-proteobacterium strain NW001) were 
      significantly reduced in response to Cu2+ concentrations of 1.7 microg l(-1) and 
      above after 14 days of exposure. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
      detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) decreased by 64% in
      sponges exposed to 223 microg l(-1) Cu2+ for 48 h and by 46% in sponges exposed
      to 19.4 microg l(-1) Cu2+ for 14 days. Electron microscopy was used to identify
      17 predominant bacterial morphotypes, composing 47% of the total observed cells
      in control sponges. A reduction in the proportion of these morphotypes to 25% of 
      observed cells was evident in sponges exposed to a Cu2+ concentration of 19.4
      microg l(-1). Although the abundance of most morphotypes decreased under Cu2+
      stress, three morphotypes were not reduced in numbers and a single morpho-type
      actually increased in abundance. Bacterial numbers, as detected using
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), decreased significantly after 48 h
      exposure to 19.4 microg l(-1) Cu2+. Archaea, which are normally prolific in R.
      odorabile, were not detected after exposure to a Cu2+ concentration of 19.4
      microg l(-1) for 14 days, indicating that many of the microorganisms associated
      with R. odorabile are sensitive to free copper. Sponges exposed to a Cu2+
      concentration of 223 microg l(-1) became highly necrosed after 48 h and
      accumulated 142 +/- 18 mg kg(-1) copper, whereas sponges exposed to 19.4 microg
      l(-1) Cu2+ accumulated 306 +/- 15 mg kg(-1) copper after 14 days without
      apoptosis or mortality. Not only do sponges have potential for monitoring
      elevated concentrations of heavy metals but also examining changes in their
      microbial symbionts is a novel and sensitive bioindicator for the assessment of
      pollution on important microbial communities.

TI  - Phylogenetic diversity of bacteria associated with the marine sponge Rhopaloeides
      odorabile.
PG  - 434-44
AB  - Molecular techniques were employed to document the microbial diversity associated
      with the marine sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile. The phylogenetic affiliation of
      sponge-associated bacteria was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing of cloned DNA
      fragments. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to confirm the
      presence of the predominant groups indicated by 16S rDNA analysis. The community 
      structure was extremely diverse with representatives of the Actinobacteria,
      low-G+C gram-positive bacteria, the beta- and gamma-subdivisions of the
      Proteobacteria, Cytophaga/Flavobacterium, green sulfur bacteria, green nonsulfur 
      bacteria, planctomycetes, and other sequence types with no known close relatives.
      FISH probes revealed the spatial location of these bacteria within the sponge
      tissue, in some cases suggesting possible symbiotic functions. The high
      proportion of 16S rRNA sequences derived from novel actinomycetes is good
      evidence for the presence of an indigenous marine actinomycete assemblage in R.
      odorabile. High microbial diversity was inferred from low duplication of clones
      in a library with 70 representatives. Determining the phylogenetic affiliation of
      sponge-associated microorganisms by 16S rRNA analysis facilitated the rational
      selection of culture media and isolation conditions to target specific groups of 
      well-represented bacteria for laboratory culture. Novel media incorporating
      sponge extracts were used to isolate bacteria not previously recovered from this 
      sponge.

TI  - Association of marine archaea with the digestive tracts of two marine fish
      species.
PG  - 2894-8
AB  - Recent studies have shown that archaea which were always thought to live under
      strict anoxic or extreme environmental conditions are also present in cold,
      oxygenated seawater, soils, the digestive tract of a holothurian deep-sea-deposit
      feeder, and a marine sponge. In this study, we show, by using PCR-mediated
      screening in other marine eukaryotes, that marine archaea are also present in the
      digestive tracts of flounder and grey mullet, two fish species common in the
      North Sea, in fecal samples of flounder, and in suspended particulate matter of
      the North Sea water column. No marine archaea could be detected in the digestive 
      tracts of mussels or the fecal pellets of a copepod species. The archaeal 16S
      ribosomal DNA clone libraries of feces of flounder and the contents of the
      digestive tracts of grey mullet and flounder were dominated by group II marine
      archaea. The marine archaeal clones derived from flounder and grey mullet
      digestive tracts and feces formed a distinct cluster within the group II marine
      archaea, with 76.7 to 89. 8% similarity to previously described group II clones. 
      Fingerprinting of the archaeal community of flounder digestive tract contents and
      feces by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of archaeal 16S rRNA
      genes after restriction with HhaI showed a dominant fragment at 249 bp, which is 
      likely to be derived from group II marine archaea. Clones of marine archaea that 
      were closely related to the fish-associated marine archaea clones were obtained
      from suspended particulate matter of the water column at two stations in the
      North Sea. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of
      the archaeal community present in suspended particulate matter showed the same
      fragment pattern as was found for the archaeal community of the flounder
      digestive tract contents and feces. These data demonstrate that marine archaea
      are present in the digestive tracts and feces of very common marine fish. It is
      possible that the marine archaea associated with the digestive tracts of marine
      fish are liberated into the water column through the feces and subsequently
      contribute to the marine archaeal community of suspended particulate matter.
